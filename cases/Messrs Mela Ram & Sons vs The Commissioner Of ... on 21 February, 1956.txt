ACT:Indian Income Tax Act,1922 (XI of 1922),ss.23,30(1)(2),31,
33-Assessment of Income-tax-Notice of demand-Appeal  against
assessment-Received  in Appellate  Assistant  Commissioner's
Office out of time-Prayer for condonation of delay rejected-
Order of Assistant Commissioner dismissing an appeal as	 out
of time-Whether one unders. 30(2)or under s. 31 of the Act-
Whether appeal competent therefrom.



HEADNOTE:
The appellant firm filed appeals against orders assessing it
to  income-tax	and super-tax for the  years  1945-1946	 and
1946-1947  beyond  the time prescribed bys.  30(2)of	 the
Income-tax Act.	 The appeals were numbered, and notices were
issued for their hearing unders. 31.  At the hearing of the
appeals	 before	 the Appellate Assistant  Commissioner,	 the
Department  took the objection that the appeals were  barred
by time.  The appellant prayed for condonation of delay, but
that  was refused, and the appeals were dismissed  as  time-
barred.	  The appellant then preferred appeals	against	 the
orders of dismissal to the Tribunal unders. 33of the	Act,
and  the  Tribunal  dismissed them on the  ground  that	 the
orders	of  the	 Assistant Commissioner	 were  in  substance
passed	unders. 30(2)and not unders. 31of the  Act	 and
that no appeal lay against them unders. 33of the Act.
On a reference unders. 66(1)of the Act the High Court held
that the orders of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner were
made  unders. 30(2)and were not appealable unders. 33of
the Act.
On appeal by special leave to the Supreme Court the question
for determination was whether an order dismissing an  appeal
presented unders. 30as out of time was one unders.  30(2)or unders. 31of the Act because if it was the former there
was  no appeal provided against it; if it was the latter  it
was open to appeal unders. 33.
Held that the orders of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner
fell withins. 31.
A  right of appeal is a substantive right and is a  creature
of the statute.	 S. 30(1) confers on the assessee a right of
appeal	against	 certain orders and an order  of  assessment
unders. 23is one of them.  The appellant had therefore  a
substantive  right unders. 30(1)to prefer appeals  against
orders of assessment made by the Income Tax Officer.
167
An  appeal presented out of time is an appeal and  an  order
dismissing it as time-barred is one passed in appeal.Section 31is the only provision relating to the hearing and
disposal of appeals and if an order dismissing an appeal  as
barred by limitation as in the present case is one passed in
appeal	it  must fall withins. 31and ass.  33confers  a
right  of appeal against all orders passed unders.  31,  it
must also be appealable.
To  fall  withins. 31it is not necessary  that  the  order
should expressly address itself to and decide on the  merits
of  the assessment and it is sufficient that the  effect  of
the order is to confirm the assessment as when the appeal is
dismissed on a preliminary point.
An  order rejecting an appeal on the, ground  of  limitation
after it had been admitted is one unders. 31, though  there
is no consideration of the merits of the assessment.
Held  therefore that the orders of the	Appellate  Assistant
Commissioner  holding that there were no sufficient  reasons
for  excusing the delay and rejecting the appeals  as  time-
barred would be orders passed unders. 31and would be	open
to  appeal, and it would make no difference in the  position
whether	 the orders of dismissal were made before  or  after
the appeals were admitted.Commissioner  of  Income-tax,  Madras v. Mtt.  `r.   S.	 Ar.

JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 17 of 1954.
Appeal	by Special Leave from the Judgment  and	 Order-dated
the 11th day of June 1951 of the Punjab High Court in  Civil
Reference No. 2 of 1951.Hardyal Hardy and Sardar Singh, for the appellant.
C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General of India (G.	N.
Joshi and R. H. Dhebar, with him) for the 'respondent.
1956.  February 21.  The Judgment of the Court was delivered
by
VENKATARIAMA  AYYAR J.--The appellant is a firm carrying  on
business at Ludhiana in the Punjab.  The Income-tax  Officer
assessed  its  income for 1945-1946 at Rs.  71,186,  and  on
17-9-1947  a  notice  of demand -was served on	it  for	 Rs.
29,857-6-0  on	account of income-tax  and  super-tax.	 The
appellant preferred an168appeal against the assessment, and it was actually  received
in the office of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner on  5-
11-1947.  It was then out of time by 19 days; but the appeal
was  registered	 as  No. 86, and notice	 for  hearing  undersection	 31was issued for 13-12-1947, and after  undergoing
several	 adjournments, it was actually heard  on  1-10-1948.
For the year 1946-1947, the Income-tax Officer assessed	 the
income	of  the	 firm at Rs. 1,09,883, and  on	29-9-1947  a
notice	of  demand was served on it for Rs.  51,313-14-0  on
account	  of  income-tax  and  super-tax.    The   appellant
preferred  an  appeal against this assessment,	and  it	 was
actually  received in the office of the Appellate  Assistant
Commissioner  on  5-11-1947, and it was then 7 days  out  of
time.	It was registered as No. 89, and notice for  hearing
undersection 31was issued for 24-6-1948.  Eventually,  it
was heard along with Appeal No. 86 on 1-10-1948.
  At the hearing, the Department took the objection that the
appeals	 were  presented  out of time,	and  were  therefore
liable	 to   be  dismissed.   The  appellant	prayed	 for
condonation of the delay on the ground that following on the
partition of the country the conditions were very unsettled,
that curfew order had been promulgated and was in force, and
that the post office did not accept registered letters,	 and
that  the traffic on the Grand Trunk Road was  closed.,	 and
that  in  view of these exceptional  circumstances,  it	 bad
sufficient cause for not presenting the appeals in time.  On
31-12-1948  the	 Appellate  Assistant  Commissioner   passed
orders	in  both  the appeals, holding that  there  was	 not
sufficient  ground  for condoning the delay,  and  rejecting
them  in limine.  These orders were purported to  be  passed
undersection 31read along withsection 30(2).
  Against  these  orders, the  appellant  preferred  appeals
undersection 33of the Act to the Appellate Tribunal  which
by  its	 order dated 4-4-1950 dismissed them on	 the  ground
that  the  orders  of the  Assistant  Commissioner  were  in
substance passed undersection 30(2) and not undersection
31and that no appeal lay against them undersection 33,  On
the applica-169tions of the appellant, the Tribunal referred undersection
66(1)of the Income Tax Act the following question for	 the
decision of the High Court of Punjab:"Whether  in the circumstances of the case appeals  lay  to
the  Tribunal  against	orders of  the	Appellate  Assistant
Commissioner dismissing the appeals against the	 assessments
for the years 19451946 and 1946-1947 in limine".
  The  reference was beard by Khosla and Harnam	 Singh	JJ.,
who  held  following an earlier decision of  that  court  in
Dewan Chand v. Commissioner of Incometax(1) that the  orders
of  the Appellate Assistant Commissioner were undersection
30(2)and not appealable undersection 33.  Certificate  to
appeal to this Court against this order having been  refused
by  the High Court, the appellant applied for  and  obtained
leave to appeal to this Court underarticle 136of the	Con-
stitution, and that is how the appeal comes before US.
  The provisions of the Act bearing on the question may	 now
be  referred  to.Section 30(1)confers on the	 assessee  a
right  of  appeal against orders passed under  the  sections
specified  therein.Section 30(2)provides that the  appeal
shall  ordinarily  be presented within thirty  days  of	 the
order	of   assessment,   but	 the   Appellate   Assistant
Commissioner may admit an appeal after the expiration of the
period if he is satisfied that the appellant bad  sufficient
cause  for  not presenting it within that  period.Section
30(3)provides that "the appeal shall be in the  prescribed
form  and  shall  be verified  in  the	prescribed  manner".Section	 31(1)enacts that "the Appellate Assistant  Commis-
sioner	shall  fix a day and place for the  hearing  of	 the
appeal,	 and  may from time to time  adjourn  the  hearing".Section	 31(3)specifies the orders that may be  passed  in
appeals according as they are directed against orders passed
under the one or the other of the sections of the Act  which
are specified insection 30(1).	 When the appeal is  against
an order of assessment undersection 23-andthis is what  we
are con-(1)  (1951] 20 1 T.R. 621,170cerned with in this appeal-it is provided insection  31(3),
clauses	 (a)  and (b) that in disposing of  the	 appeal	 the
Appellate  Assistant Commissioner may (a)  confirm,  reduce,
enhance	 or  annul  the assessment, or	(b)  set  aside	 the
assessment  and	 direct the.  Incometax Officer	 to  make  a
fresh  assessment after making such further enquiry  as	 the
Income-tax Officer thinks fit.Section 33(1)enacts that,
"Any  assessee objecting to an order passed by an  Appellate
Assistant  Commissioner undersection 28orsection  31may
appeal	to the Appellate Tribunal within sixty days  of	 the
date on which such order is communicated to him".
 Stated succinctly,section 30confers a right of appeal  on
the  assessee,section	 31provides  for  the	hearing	 and
disposal  of the appeal, andsection 33confers a  right  of
further appeal against orders passed undersection 31,
 Now,  on these provisions the question is whether an  order
dismissing  an appeal presented undersection 30as  out  of
time  is one undersection 30(2)or undersection 31of	 the
Act.   If  it  is the former, there is	no  appeal  provided
against it; if it is the latter, it is open to appeal  undersection	 33.   On  this question, there	 has  been  a  sharp
conflict  of  opinion among different High Courts  and	even
among different Benches of the same High Court.	 The  Bombay
High Court has held that when an appeal is presented out  of
time,  and there is no order of condonation of	delay  undersection	 30(2),	 there	is, in law,  no	 appeal	 before	 the
Appellate  Assistant Commissioner, and that an order by	 him
rejecting the appeal does not fall withinsection 31and  is
not  appealable:Commissioner of Income-tax v.	Mysore	Ironand Steel Works(1) andK. K. Porbunderwalla v.	Commissioner
of  Income-tax(2); but that if the appeal is admitted  after
an  order  of condonation is made undersection  30(2),  an
order  subsequently  passed dismissing it on the  ground  of
limitation  would  be  one undersection  31and  would  be
appealable undersection 33and the result will be the	same
even when the appeal is admitted without
(1) .[1949] 17 I.T.R. 478,
(2) [1952] 21 I.T.R. 63.171any  order of condonation undersection 30(2):	Champalal  A
sharam v. Commissioner of Income-tax(1).
 The  High Court of Allahabad has also taken the same  view,
and  held  that	 an  order refusing  to	 condone  delay	 and
rejecting an appeal before it was admitted was not one undersection	 31and was not appealable:Vide Shivnath Prasad  v.
Commissioner  of  Income-tax,  Centraland  U.	 P.(3)	 and
Municipal Board, Agra v. Commissioner of Income-tax, U.	 P.(
3 ); but that ail order dismissing the appeal as time-barred
after it had been admitted was one undersection 31and	 was
appeable:Mohd.	 Nain Mohd.  Alam v. Commissioner of Income-
tax(1).	  The  High  Court  of	Punjab	has  held  followingShivnath  Prasad v. Commissioner of  Incometax, Centraland
U.  P.(2) and Commissioner of Incometax v. Mysore  Iron	 and
Steel	Works(5)   that	  when	 the   Appellate   Assistant
Commissioner  declines	to  condone delay  and	rejects	 the
appeal,	 it is one undersection 30(2)and  not	 appealable.
It  has	 further  held	that even if  the  appeal  bad	been
admitted  without an order of condonation and  dismissed  at
the  hearing  on the ground of limitation, it would  not  be
undersection 31, because the scheme of the Act contemplated
that an order to be passed under that section must relate to
the  merits of the assessment.	It is on this decision	that
the judgment under appeal is based It may be mentioned	that
the decision inDewan Chand v. Commissioner of Income-tax(6)
was  dissented from in a recent decision of the Punjab	High
Court inGeneral Agencies v. Income-tax Commissioner(7) .In  Commissioner of Income-tax v. Shahzadi Begum the  Madras
HighCourt has held that an order-declining to excuse  delay
and rejecting the appeal is one undersection 31, whether it
is made before the appeal is admitted or after, and that  an
appeal which is filed out of time is, nonetheless, an appeal
for purposes ofsection 31, and that an order dismissing  it
would be appealable undersection 33.  In Gour Mohan
(1)  [1953] 23 I.T.R. 464,
(3)  [1951] 19 I.T.R. 63.(5)  [1949] 17 I.T.R. 478.(7)  A.I R. 1956 Punjab 26.(2)  [1936] 3 I.T.R. 200.(4)  [1951] 19 I.T.R. 58.(6)  [1951] 20 I.T.R. 621.(8)  [1952] 21 I.T.R. 1.172Mullick	 v. Commissioner of Agricultural Income-tax(1),	 the
Calcutta  High Court has, after a full discussion,  come  to
the  conclusion that an order of dismissal on the ground  of
limitation  at	whatever  stage was  one  which	 fell  undersection	 31.   It  is  unnecessary to  refer  to  the  views
expressed  in decisions of other High Courts, as  the  point
now  under  discussion did not directly arise  for  decision
therein.The question is which of these views is the correct one to
adopt.	We start with this that undersection 33it is	only
orders	undersection 31that are appealable.  The  question
therefore narrows itself to this whether an order  declining
to condone delay and dismissing the appeal as barred by time
is  an order undersection 31.	It will be, if it is  passed
in  appeal against an order of assessment, and is one  which
affirms	 it.   Now, the conflicting views expressed  by	 the
several	 High  Courts centre round two points: (1)  when  an
appeal is presented out of time and there has been a refusal
to condone delay undersection 30(2), is an order  rejecting
it as time-barred one passed in appeal; and (2) if it is, is
such  an order one confirming the assessment withinsection
31(3)(a)?On the first point, as already stated, it has been held by
the  Bombay  High Court that while an  order  dismissing  an
appeal	as  time-barred after it is admitted  is  one  undersection 31, a similar order passed before it is admitted  is
one  undersection 30(2).  The ratio of this distinction  is
stated	to  be that in law there is no appeal unless  it  is
presented in time, and if presented beyond time, unless	 the
delay  is excused.In Commissioner of Income-tax v.  Mysore
Iron  and Steel Works(2), Chagla, C.J. stated  the  position
thus:"An  asseesee has a statutory right to present  an  appeal
within thirty days without any order being required from the
Appellate  Assistant  Commissioner  for	 admission  of	that
appeal.	  But  if  the time prescribed	expires,  then	that
statutory right to present an appeal goes; and an appeal can
only be entertained provided it is admitted by the Appellate
Assistant Commissioner after condoning the delay.
(1) [1952] 22 I.T.R. 131.(2) [1949] 17 I.T.R. 478.173Therefore  before an appeal could be admitted in this  case,
an  order  from	 the Appellate	Assistant  Commissioner	 was
requisite  that the delay had been condoned and it was	only
on  such  an  order  being made that  the  appeal  could  be
entertained  by the Appellate Assistant	 Commissioner.	 Nowsection 31deals only with such appeals which are  presented
within the prescribed period or admitted after the delay has
been  condoned,	 and the procedure laid down insection  31with  regard to the hearing of appeals only applies to	such
appeals.   Therefore,  in  my opinion,	when  the  Appellate
Assistant  Commissioner refused to condone the delay,  there
was no appeal before him which he could hear and dispose  of
as  provided undersection 31of the Act.Section  33then
gives the right of appeal to the assessee from an order made
by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner either undersection
28or undersection 31.  Therefore the Legislature did	 not
give  the right of appeal to the assessee against  an  order
made  by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner undersection
30of the Act".Learned	 counsel for the appellant disputes the	 correctness
of  the	 last  observation that an order  of  the  Appellate
Assistant  comissioner refusing to condone the delay is	 one
undersection 30(2), and contends that the only order	that
could  be passed under that section was one excusing  delay,
and  an order refusing to condone it will fall	outside	 it,
and that such an order could only be made undersection	 31.
We  find  it difficult to accede to this  contention.	When
power  is  granted to an authority to be  exercised  at	 his
discretion, it is necessarily implicit in the grant that  he
may  exercise it in such manner as the	circumstances  might
warrant.  And if the Appellate Assistant Commissioner has  a
discretion to excuse the delay, he has also a discretion  in
appropriate cases to decline to do so.	We are therefore  of
opinion	 that the refusal to excuse delay is an order  undersection 30(2.).But  the question still remains whether the view  taken  inCommissioner of Income-tax v. Mysore Iron23174and  Steel Works(1) and K. K. Porbunderwalla v	Commissioner
of  Income-tax (2) that an appeal which is filed beyond	 the
period	of  limitation	is, in the eye of  law,	 no  appeal,
unless and until there is a condonation of delay, and  that,
in consequence, an order passed thereon cannot be held to be
passed	in appeal so as to fall withinsection 31is  right.
Now,  a	 right of appeal is a substantive right,  and  is  a
creature  of  the  statute.Section 30(1)confers  on	 the
assessee  a right of appeal against certain orders,  and  an
order  of assessment undersection 23is one of	 them.	 The
appellant  therefore had a substantive right  undersection
30(1)to prefer appeals against orders of assessment made by
the  Income-tax	 Officer.  Then, we come tosection  30(2),
which enacts a period of limitation within which this  right
is  to be exercised.  If an appeal, is not presented  within
that time, does that cease to be an appeal as provided undersection	 30(1)?	  It  is  well	established  that  rules  of
limitation,  pertain  to the domain of adjectival  law,	 and
that  they  operate  only  to bar  the	remedy	but  not  to
extinguish  the	 right.	 An appeal preferred  in  accordance
withsection 30(1)must, therefore, be an appeal in the	 eye
of  law,  though  having been presented	 beyond	 the  period
mentioned  insection 30(2)it is liable to be dismissed  in
limine.	  There might be a provision in the statute that  at
the  end of the period of limitation prescribed,  the  right
would  be  extinguished, as for example,section 28of	 the
Limitation  Act; but there is none such here.  On the  other
hand,  in conferring a right of appeal undersection  30(1)and  prescribing  a period of limitation  for  the  exercise
thereof separately undersection 30(2), the legislature has
evinced	 an  intention	to maintain  the  distinction  well-
recognised   under  the	 general  law  between	what  is   a
substantive  right and what is a matter of  procedural	law.
In  Nagendranath  Dey v. Suresh Chandra Dey(3)	Sir  Dinshaw
Mulla  construing the word ' appeal' in the third column  ofarticle 182of theLimitation Actobserved:
 "There is no definition of appeal in the Civil Pro-
(1) [1949] 17 I.T.R. 478.     (2) [1952] 21 I.T.R. 63.
(3)  59 I.A. 283, 287.175cedure	Code,  but their Lordships have no  doubt  that	 any
application by a party to an appellate, Court, asking it  to
set aside or revise a decision of a subordinate Court, is an
appeal within the ordinary acceptation of the term, and that
it  is	no  less  an  appeal  because  it  is  irregular  or
incompetent".These	observations  were  referred to	 with  approval	 and
adopted by this Court inRaja Kulkarni and others v.   The
State of Bombay(1).In Promotho Nath Roy v. W.	  A. Lee(2),
an  order dismissing an application as barred by  limitation
after  rejecting  an  application undersection  5of	 the
Limitation Act to excuse the delay in presentation was	held
to  be one "passed on appeal" within the meaning of  section
109  of	 the Civil Procedure Code.  On the  principles	laid
down in these decisions, it must be held that an appeal pre-
sented out of time is an appeal, and an order dismissing  it
as time-barred is one passed in appeal.Then,  the  next question is whether it is an  order  passed
undersection	31of the Act.	 That section  is  the	only
provision  relating to the hearing and disposal of  appeals,
and if an order dismissing an appeal as barred by limitation
is  one	 passed in appeal, it must fall withinsection	 31.
And  assection 33confers a right of	appeal	against	 all
orders passed undersection 31, it must also be	 appealable.
But  then,  it	is  contended  that  in	 an  appeal  against
assessment the only order that could be passed undersection
31(3)(a) is one which confirms, reduces, enhances or annuls
the  assessment, that such an order could be made only on  a
consideration of the merits of the appeal, and that an order
dismissing it on the ground of limitation is not within	 the
section.   That	 was  the  view	 taken	inDewan  Chand  v.
Commissioner  of Income-tax(3).	 But there is practically  a
unanimity of opinion among all the other High Courts that to
fall within the section it is not necessary that the-  order
should expressly address itself to and decide on the  merits
of the assessment, and that it is sufficient that the effect
of the order is to confirm the assessment
(1) [1954] S.C.R. 384, 388.   (2) A.I.R. 1921 Cal. 415.(3) [1951] 20 I.T.R. 621.176as when the appeal is dismissed on a preliminary point.In
Commissioner	of   Income-tax	  v.   Shahzadi	   Begum(1),
Satyanarayana Rao, J. said:"If  the appeal is dismissed as incompetent or is  rejected
as  it	was filed out of time and no  sufficient  cause	 was
established,  it  results  in an affirmation  of  the  order
appealed against".In  Gour  Mohan  Mullick v.  Commissioner  of	Agricultural
Income-tax(2),	construing  sections 34, 35 and	 36  of	 the
Bengal	Agricultural  Income-Tax  Act  which  are  in  terms
identical with those ofsections 30,31and33of the Indian
Income-Tax Act, Chakravarti, J. observed:
  "I  would base that view on the ground that the order,  in
effect,	 confirmed the assessment or, at any rate,  disposed
of  the	 appeal	 and was thus an  order	 undersection	 35,
because what that section really contemplates is a  disposal
or  conclusion	of  the	 appeal	 and  the  forms  of  orders
specified in it are not exhaustive.  An appellate order	 may
not,  directly and by itself, confirm, or reduce or  enhance
or  annul an assessment and may yet dispose of	the  appeal.
If  it	does so, it is immaterial whether the  ground  is  a
finding that the appeal is barred by limitation or a finding
that  the  case is not a fit one for extension	of  time  or
both".This  reasoning is also the basis of the decisions  of	 the
Bombay	and Allahabad High Courts which bold that  an  order
rejecting an appeal on the ground of limitation after it had
been  admitted is one undersection 31, though there  is  no
consideration of the merits of the assessment.	Thus, inK.
K. Porbunderwalla v. Commissioner of Income-tax(3),  Chagla,
C. J. observed:``....	although the Appellate Assistant Commis	 sioner	 did
not  hear the appeal on merits and held that the appeal	 was
barred by limitation his order was undersection 31and	 the
effect of that order was to confirm the assessment which bad
been made by the Income-tax Officer".In Special Manager of Court ofWards v. Commissioner(1) [1952] 21 I.T.R. 1.		 (2) [1952] 22 I.T.R. 131.
(3)  [1952] 21 I.T.R. 63.177of  Income-tax(1), the Allahabad High Court stated that	 the
view was "possible that even though the period of limitation
is  prescribed	undersection 30and  the  power  to  grant
extension is also given in that section the power is  really
exercised  undersection  31as  the	Appellate  Assistant
Commissioner  when  he decides not to extend the  period  of
limitation  may	 be said in a sense to	have  confirmed	 the
assessment".The  respondent  relied  on  a  later	 decision  of	the)
'Allahabad  High  Court	 inMahabir  Prasad  Niranjanlal  v.
Commissioner  of Income-tax(2), wherein it was held  by	 the
learned	 Judges,  departing  from  the	previous  course  of
authorities  of that court, that an order of  the  Appellate
Assistant  Commissioner dismissing an appeal as	 time-barred
was  one undersection 30(2)and not undersection  31,	 and
was  therefore	not appealable.	 This conclusion  they	felt
themselves bound to adopt by reason of certain	observations
of this Court inCommissioner of Income-tax, Madras v.	Mtt.
Ar.  S. Ar.  Arunachalam Chettiar(3).  But when read in	 the
context	 of  the point that actually arose for	decision  in
that  case,  those  observations  lend	no  support  to	 the
conclusion reached by the learned Judges.  There, the  facts
were  that  an appeal was preferred by	the  assessee  undersection	 30(1)against an order of the	Income-tax  Officer,
and   that   was  dismissed  by	 the   Appellate   Assistant
Commissioner  on 19-11-1945 as incompetent.  No	 appeal	 was
filed  against this order, and it became final.	 But  acting
on  a  suggestion made in the order  dated  19-11-1945,	 the
assessee filed an original miscellaneous application  before
the  Appellate Tribunal for relief, and by its	order  dated
20-2-1946 the Tribunal set aside the findings of the Income-
tax  Officer, and directed him to make a fresh	computation.
Then, on the application of the Commissioner of	 Income-tax,
the Tribunal referred to the High Court undersection  66(1)of the Income-tax Act the following question:
  "Whether in the facts and circumstances of the
case, the order of the Bench dated 20th February,
(1) [1950] 18 I.T.R. 204, 212.	(2 ) [1955] 27 I.T.R. 268.
(3)  [1953] S.C.R. 463: 474-475,1781946  in  the miscellaneous application	 is  an	 approoriate
order	and   is  legally  valid  and  passed	within	 the
jurisdiction and binding on the Income-tax Officer".
  The  High Court declined to answer this reference  on	 the
ground that the order of the Tribunal was not one passed  in
an appeal undersection 33(1), and that In consequence,	 the
reference  undersection 66(1)was itself incompetent.	 The
correctness  of	 this decision was challenged on  appeal  to
this Court, and in affirm ing it, this Court observed:
  ........  when  on  19th  November  1945,  the   Appellate
Assistant  Commissioner	 declined to admit the	appeal,	 the
assessee  did  not  prefer  any	 appeal	 but  only  made   a
miscellaneous  application  before the	Appellate  Tribunal.
There  is  no  provision  in  the  Act	permitting  such  an
application.   Indeed,	in  the statement of  the  case	 the
Appellate   Tribunal  states  that  in	 entertaining	that
application  and  correcting  the error	 of  the  Income-tax
Officer	 it  acted in exercise of what it  regarded  as	 its
inherent powers.  There being no appeal undersection  33(1)and  the order having been made in exercise of its  supposed
inherent jurisdiction, the order cannot possibly be regarded
as  one undersection 33(4)and there being no	order  undersection	 33(4)there could be no  reference  undersection
66(1)or (2), and the appellate Court properly refused to
entertain it".There is, of course, nothing in the decision itself  which
bears  on  the	point now  under  discussion.	But  certain
observations occurring at pages 474 and 475 were referred to
by  the learned Judges as leading to the conclusion that  an
order  dismissing  an appeal as barred by  time	 would	fall
undersection 3O(2).  Now, those observations came to be made
by  way	 of answer to a new contention put  forward  by	 the
learned,  Attorney-General in support of the  appeal.	That
contention was that the miscellaneous application  presented
to  the Tribunal might be treated as an appeal	against	 the
order  dated  19-11-1945,  in which case  the  order  passed
thereon on 20-2-1946 would fall undersection 33(4)and	 the
reference would be com-179petent.	  'In disagreeing with this contention,	 this  Court
observed   that	 the  appeal  to  the  Appellate   Assistant
Commissioner was incompetent undersection 30(1), that	even
if it was competent, the order dated 19-11-1945 was not	 one
contemplated  bysection 31, and there could be  no  appeal
against	 such an order undersection 33(1).  Now, it  should
be noticed that the question actually referred undersection
66(1)was the correctness and legality of the order  passed
in a miscellaneous application and not of any order made  in
an  appeal preferred undersection 33(1).  In this  context,
the  point  sought to be raised by  the	 learned,  Attorney-
General	 did  not  arise  at  all  for	decision,  and	 the
observations   in  answer  thereto  cannot  be	read  as   a
pronouncement on the question of the maintainability of	 the
appeal, much less as a decision that an order dismissing  an
appeal	as barred by limitation is one undersection  30(2).
Accordingly,  the  question whether an order  dismissing  an
appeal as barred by limitation falls undersection 30(2)orsection 31remains unaffected by the observations in Commis-
sioner	of Income-tax, Madras v. Mtt.  Ar.  S.	Ar.   Aruna-
chalam Chettiar(1).Then again, under the provisions of the Act, limitation is
not the only preliminary ground on which an appeal could  be
disposed of without a consideration of the merits.Section
30(3)provides that an "appeal shall be in  the  prescribed
form  and shall be verified in the prescribed  manner".	  If
the  Appellate Assistant Commissioner holds that the  appeal
does not comply with the requirements of this enactment	 and
rejects it on that ground, the order must be one made  undersection 31, sincesection 30(3)makes no provision for	such
an  order, as doessection 30(2)in the case of	 limitation.
All  the  orders  undersection 31being  appealable  undersection	 33, the order of dismissal for	 noncompliance	withsection 30(3)must also be appealable, and it was so decided
inMaharani Gyan Manjari Kuari v. Commissioner	 of  Income-
tax(2)	.  How	is  this view  to  be  reconciled  with	 the
contention thatsection 31contemplates only orders on the
(1) [1953] S.C.R. 463.(2) (1944) 12 I.T.R. 59.180merits	of  the assessment and not  on	preliminary  issues?
Vide also the decision in Kunwarji Ananda v. Commissioner of
Income-tax(1),	which was followed inMaharani Gyan  Manjari
Kuari  v. Commissioner of Income-tax(2), and in	 Ramnarayana
Das Mandal v. Commissioner of Income-tax(3).  There is	thus
abundant  authority for the position thatsection 31should
be  liberally  construed so as to include  not	only  orders
passed	on a consideration of the merits of  the  assessment
but  also orders which dispose of the appeal on	 preliminary
issues, such as limitation and the like.The  learned	Solicitor-General sought to get	 over  these
decisions  by taking up the position thatsection 31(3)(a)
construed  in  its  literal and	 ordinary  sense,  conferred
jurisdiction on the Appellate Assistant Commissioner only to
pass orders on the merits of the assessment, that it was not
therefore  open to him to entertain any question  which	 did
not directly relate to such merits, and that accordingly  he
could  not hear or decide any issue of a preliminary  nature
such as limitation, and dispose of the appeal on the  ,basis
of  the	 finding  on  that issue.   He	conceded  that	this
contention  would run counter to numerous  authorities,	 but
argued	 that  they  were  all	wrong.	 Having	 given	 due
consideration to this contention, we are of opinion that  it
is not well-founded.Taking  the  plea  of	 limitation-which  is  what  we	 are
concerned  with in this appeal when there is a	judgment  or
order  against which the statute provides a right of  appeal
but  none is preferred within the time prescribed  therefor,
the respondent acquires a valuable right, of which he cannot
be  deprived by an order condoning delay and  admitting	 the
appeal behind his back.	 And when such an order is passed ex
partehe	 has  a right to challenge its	correctness  at	 the
bearing	 of  the  appeal.  That is the	position  under	 the
general	 law  (vide  Krishnasami .Panikondar	v.  Ramasami
Chettiar(4),  and there is nothing in the provisions of	 theIncome Tax Act, which enacts a different principle.
(1)  I	L.R. 11 Patna 187; A.I.R. 1931 Patna 306;  5  I.T.C.417.
(2) [1944]12 I.T.R. 59.	       (3) (1950) 18 I.T.R. 660.
(4) [1918] I.L.R. 41 Mad. 412; 45 I.A. 25.181Therefore,  if	an appeal is admitted without  the  fact  of
delay  in presentation having been noticed, clearly it	must
be open to the Department to raise the objection at the time
of the hearing of the appeal.  That would also appear to  be
the  practice obtaining before. the Income-tax Tribunal,  as
appears from the decisions cited before us, and that, in our
opinion,  is right.  Similar considerations would  apply  to
other  objections  of a preliminary character, such  as	 one
based onsection 30, sub-section (3).  We should be slow  to
adopt  a  construction which deprives  parties	of  valuable
rights.	  We  are  therefore  of  opinion  that	 contentions
relating to preliminary issues are open to consideration  at
the  time  of  the  hearing of	the  appeal,  and  that	 the
jurisdiction of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner is	 not
limited	 to the bearing of the appeal on the merits  of	 the
assessment only.  In this view, the orders of the  Appellate
Assistant Commissioner holding that there were no sufficient
reasons for excusing the delay and rejecting the appeals  as
time-barred  would  be orders passed undersection  31and
would be open to appeal, and it would make no difference  in
the  position whether the order of dismissal is made  before
or after the appeal is admitted.The  question referred must accordingly be answered  in	 the
affirmative.  This appeal will therefore be allowed, and the
order of the court below set aside.  The appellant will have
his costs here and in the court below.24182
