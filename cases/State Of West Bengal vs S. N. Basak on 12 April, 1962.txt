HEADNOTE:
A  Sub-Inspcctor  of  Police, Enforcement  Branch,  filed  a
report	before	the  Police Officer-in-charge  of  a  Police
Station alleging that the respondent along with three others
committed offences under ss.420, 120B read with s.420Indian
Penal Code.  Thereupon a First Information Report was  drawn
up   and   investigation  was	started.    The	  respondent
surrendered  before  the  judicial  Magistrate	and  he	 was
released  on bail.  Subsequently he filed an application  in
the  High  Court  underss. 439and561A  of  the  Criminal
Procedure  Code to get the case pending before the  judicial
Magistrate arising out of the
53
case registered in the Police Station quashed.	This  appli-
cation	was  granted by the High Court.	 The  appellant	 the
State of West Bengal then filed an appeal before the Supreme
Court  by certificate granted by the High Court	 underArt.
134 (1) (c)of the Constitution.
Held,  that the statutory powers given to the  Police  under
ss.  154  and  156of the Codeof  Criminal  Procedure  to
investigate into the circumstances of an alleged  cognizable
offence	 without  authority  from  a  Magistrate  cannot  be
interfered with by the exercise of powers under s.439of the
Codeof  Criminal Procedure or under  the  inherent  powers
conferred bys. 561Aof the Code of Criminal Procedure.	 The
High   Court  was  therefore  in  error	 in   allowing	 the
respondent's application.

JUDGMENT:CRIMINAL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 30  of
1961.Appeal	from the judgment and order dated September 6,	1960
of the Calcutta High Court in Cr. Revision No. 647 of 1960.
B.   Sen,  P.  K.  Chatterjee  and  P.	K.  Bose,  for	 the
appellant.D. C. Roy and P. K. Mukherjee, for the respondent.
1962.  April 12.  The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
KAPUR,	J.-This is an appeal against the judgment and  order
of  the	 High Court of Calcutta quashing  the  investigation
started	 against the respondent in regard to offences  under
s.  420,Indian Penal Code, ands. 120Bread withs. 420of
the Indian Penal Code.On  March  26, 1960, Sub- Inspector.B. L.  Gbose  of  Police
Inforcement  Branch  filed  a  written	report	before	 the
Officer-in-charge   Chakdha   P.  S.,  alleging	  that	 the
respondent in conspiracy with three others54had  cheated the Government of West Bengal of a sum  of	 Rs.
20,000.	  The respondent at the time was  an  Assistant-cum-
Executive  Engineer, Kancbrapara Development  Area,  Kalyani
Division.   On the basis of this report a First	 Information
Report was drawn up and the police started investigation. On
April 4, 1960, the respondent surrendered in the  court	  of
the Judicial Magistrate at Ranaghat and was released on bail
for  a	sum of Rs. 1,000/-.  The respondent then on  May  9,
1960,  filed  a	 petition  underss. 439and561Aof	 the
Criminal  Procedure Code and prayed for a rule	against	 the
District  Magistrate, Nadia, to show cause why the  judicial
case   pending	in  the	 court	of  the	 Senior	  Magistrate
Ranagaghat  arising out of the Chakdah Police  Station	Case
No. 33 dated March 26, 1960, be not quashed.  The High Court
held :-"In   our	  view,	 the  statutory	  power	  of
	      investigation   given  to	 the  police   under
	      Chapter XIV is not available in respect of  an
	      offence triable under the West Bengal Criminal
	      Law  Amendment (Special Courts) Act 1949,	 and
	      that being so, the investigation concerned  is
	      without  jurisdiction.  In so saying,  we	 are
	      consicious of the observations of their  Lord-
	      ships  of the Privy Council in  Nazir  Ahmad's
	      case, 71 Indian Appeals, 203".and  therefore quashed the police investigation of the	case
holding	 it to be without jurisdiction.	 It is against	this
judgment and order that the state has come in appeal to this
Court on a certificate granted by the High Court underArt.
134 (1) (c)At  the time the respondent filed the petition in  the	High
Court  only a written report was made to the police  by	 the
Sub-Inspector of police Enforcement Branch and on the  basis
of  that report a :First Information Report was recorded  by
the55Officer-in-charge  of the Police Station  and  investigation
had  started.	There  was  no	case  pending  at  the	time
excepting that the respondent had appeared before the Court,
had surrendered and had' been admitted to bail.	 The  powers
of  investigation into cognizable offences are contained  in
Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure.Section	 154which	is  in	that  Chapter  deals  with  information	  in
cognizable offences ands. 156with investigation into	such
offences  and  under  these  sections  the  police  has	 the
statutory right to investigate into the circumstances of any
alleged	 cognizable offence without authority from  a  Magi-
strate and this statutory power of the police to investigate
cannot be interfered with by the exercise of power unders.
439or under the inherent power of the court unders.	561Aof  Criminal  Procedure	 Code.	 As to	the  powers  of	 the
Judiciary  in  regard to statutory right of  the  police  to
investigate,  the  Privy Council in King Emperor  v.  Khwaja
Nazir Ahmad (1) observed as follows:-"The functions of the judiciary and the police
	      are  complementary, not overlapping,  and	 the
	      combination  of individual liberty with a	 due
	      observance  of  law and order is	only  to  be
	      obtained	by leaving each to exercise its	 own
	      function,	 always,  a course, subject  to	 the
	      right   of  the  court  to  intervene  in	  an
	      appropriate  case when moved unders.  491of
	      the Criminal Procedure Code to give directions
	      in  the nature of habeas, corpus.	 In  such  a
	      case  as	the present,  however,	the  court's
	      functions	 begin	when a charge  is  preferred
	      before  it,  and	not  until  then.   It	 has
	      sometimes been thought that a. 561A has  given
	      increased powers to the Court which it did not
	      possess before that section was enacted.	 But
	      this  is	not  so, the section  gives  no	 now
	      powers, it
	      (1)(1944),L..R. 71. 1. A. 203, 212.56only  provides  that  those  which  the  court
	      already	inherently   possesses	 shall	  be
	      preserved	 and is inserted as their  Lordships
	      think,  lest it should be considered that	 the
	      only  powers possessed by the court are  those
	      expressly conferred bythe Criminal  Procedure
	      Codeand that no inherent powers had  survived
	      the passing of that Act".With  this  interpretation,  which  has	 been  put  on	 the
statutory duties and. powers of the police and of the powers
of the Court, we are in accord.	 The High Court was in error
therefore  in interfering with the powers of the  police  in
investigating  into  the offence which was  alleged  in	 the
information  sent  to the Officer-in-charge  of	 the  police
station.We  therefore allow this appeal and set aside the  order  of
the  High  Court.   The investigation will  now	 proceed  in
accordance with law.Appeal allowed.
