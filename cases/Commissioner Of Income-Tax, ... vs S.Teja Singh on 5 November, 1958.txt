HEADNOTE:
The respondent who bad not been assessed to income-tax prior
to the assessment year 1948-49 made suo motu returns on July
4,  1949,  showing  an income of Rs. 4,494  and	 Rs.  31,646
respectively, for the assessment years 1948-49 and  1949-5o,
but  failed to send an estimate of the tax on his income  as
provided  ins. 18A(3)of the Indian Income-tax	 Act,  1922.
The  Incometax Officer took action unders. 28read withs.
18A(9)of the Act and imposed a penalty on him for the years
1948-49 and 1949-50.
395
The  Appellate	Tribunal held that the	order  imposing	 the
penalty	 was ultra vires on the ground thats. 28would,  in
terms, apply only when a person failed to furnish the return
when he was required so to do by notice unders. 22ors. 34of  the	 Act, and that there could be no such  notices	with
reference to estimates of tax on income to be sent unders.
18A(3).	 The High Court, on reference, agreed with the	view
of the Tribunal.
Held,  that  in view of the legal fiction  contained  ins.
18A(9)of the Act that when an assessee has failed to comply
withs.	  18A(3)he  "shall  be deemed to  have  failed  to
furnish the return of his total income and the provisions of
s.  28,	 so far as may be, shall apply	accordingly  ",	 the
failure	 to  send  an estimate of the tax  unders.  18A(3)should	be  treated as failure to furnish return  of  income
unders. 22.  Accordingly, it was competent to the  Income-
tax authorities to impose a penalty underS. 28read withs.
18A(9)(b)where there has been a failure to comply withs.
18A(3).
The relevant provisions of theIndian Income-tax Act,  1922,

JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 122 of 1957.
Appeal from the order dated November 4, 1954, of the  Punjab
High  Court (Circuit Bench) at Delhi in Civil Reference	 No.
15 of 1953.R.   Ganapathy	Iyer,  R. H. Dhebar and D.  Gupta,  for	 the
appellant.P.   M. Mukhi, Gopal Singh for Udhai Bhan Choudhry, for	 the
respondent.P.   M. Mukhi and Ganpat Rai, for Dalmia Jain Aviation	Ltd.
(now Asia Udyog Ltd.) (Intervener).1958.	November 5. The Judgment of the Court was  delivered
by
VENKATARAMA AIYAR, J.-This is an appeal against the judgment
of the High Court of Punjab in a reference unders. 66(1)of
the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, hereinafter referred to  as
the Act.The facts are that the respondent, had not been assessed  to
income-tax prior to the assessment year 1948-49.  On July 4,
1949,  he  made suo motu returns showing an  income  of	 Rs.
4,494  for  the accounting year 1947-48 being  the  previous
year  for the assessment year 1948-49 and an income  of	 Rs.
31,646 for396the accounting year 1948-49 being the previous year for	 the
assessment  year 1949-50.  By orders dated August 25,  1949,
the   Income-tax  Officer  assessed  the  income   for	 the
assessment year 1948-49 at Rs. 6,277 and for the  assessment
year 1949-50 at Rs. 36,281.  The correctness of these orders
is  not	 in question before us.	 We are concerned  in  these
proceedings with the vires of an order, which the Income-tax
Officer	 made on October 9, 1950, unders. 28read withss.
18A(3)and18A(9)of the Act.  It will be convenient to	 set
out  these provisions, so far as they are material  for	 the
purpose of this appeal.Section 18A(3)provides that :
"  Any	person	who has not hitherto  been  assessed  shall,
before the 15th day of March in each financial year, if	 his
total income of the period which would be the previous	year
for  an assessment for the financial year next following  is
likely to exceed six thousand rupees, send to the Income-tax
Officer	 an estimate of the tax payable by him on that	part
of  his income to which the provisions ofsection 18do	 not
apply  of  the said previous year calculated in	 the  manner
laid  down in sub-section (1), and shall pay the amount,  on
such of the dates specified in that sub-section as have	 not
expired,  by instalments which may be revised  according  to
the proviso to sub-section (2)."Section 18A(9)is as follows:"   If	the  Income-tax	 Officer,  in  the  course  of	 any
proceedings  in connection with the regular  assessment,  is
satisfied that any assessee-(a)  has  furnished under sub-section (2) or  sub-section(3)
estimates of the tax payable by him which he knew or	 had
reason to believe to be untrue, or(b)  has without reasonable cause failed to comply with	 the
provisions of subsection (3), the assessee shall be  deemed,
in the case referred to in clause (a), to have	deliberately
furnished  inaccurate particulars of his income, and in	 the
case  referred to in clause (b), to have failed	 to  furnish
the  return  of	 his total income;  and	 the  provisions  ofsection 28, so far' as may be, shall apply accordingly:".397Then, there is a proviso which imposes a limit on the amount
of penalty, which can be levied.Section 28of the Act runs
as follows:(1) " If the Income-tax Officer....... in the course of	 any
proceedings under this Act, is satisfied that any person-(a)has without reasonable cause failed to furnish the return
of  his	 total income which he was required  to	 furnish  by
notice	given  under sub-section (1) or	 subsection  (2)  ofsection	 22orsection 34or has without  reasonable  cause
failed	to  furnish it within the time allowed	and  in	 the
manner required by such notice, or(b)has	without	 reasonable cause failed to  comply  with  a
notice under subsection (4) ofsection 22or subsection	 (2)
ofsection 23, or(c)has	 concealed   the  particulars  of  his	 income	  or
deliberately   furnished  inaccurate  particulars  of	such
income,
he.....	 may  direct that such person shall pay	 by  way  of
penalty, in the case referred to in clause (a), in  addition
to  the	 amount	 of the income-tax  and	 supertax,  if	any,
payable by him a sum not exceeding one and a half times that
amount, and in the cases referred to in clauses (b) and (c),
in  addition to any tax payable by him, a sum not  exceeding
one and a half times the amount of the income-tax and super-
tax, if any, which would have been avoided if the income  as
returned  by  such person had been accepted as	the  correct
income:".The  Income-tax	 Officer  held that as	the  respondent	 had
failed	to  send  an estimate of the tax on  his  income  as
provided  ins.  18A(3)he became liable  to  be  proceeded
against	 unders. 28, and accordingly imposed a	 penalty  of
Rs. 40 for the year 1948-49 and Rs. 1,000 for the year 1949-50.    On  appeal,  the	 Appellate  Assistant	Commissioner
confirmed  the order in so far as it imposed a	penalty	 for
the year 1948-49 but set it aside as regards the year  1949-
50  on the ground that by reason of the assessment  for	 the
year 1948-49 the respondent ceased to be a new assessee	 for
1949-50,  and  that,  in  consequence,	s.  18A(3)  had	  no
application.   Against the order cancelling the penalty	 for
1949-50,398the Income-tax Officer preferred an appeal to the  Appellate
Tribunal,  which  disagreed with the view of  the  Appellate
Assistant  Commissioner that the respondent was no longer  a
new assessee withins. 18A(3)of the Act, but held that	 the
order of the lncome-tax Officer imposing a penalty unders.
28was ultra vires, because that section would,  in  terms,
apply  only when a person failed to furnish the return	when
he  was required so to do by notice unders. 22ors. 34of
the  Act,  and	that there could be  Do	 such  notices	with
reference to estimates of tax on income to be sent unders.
18A(3).	  In  the result, the appeal was dismissed.  On	 the
application  of	 the appellant, the  Tribunal  referred	 the
following question for the opinion of the High	  Court:
" Whether on a true construction ofSection 18A(9)(b) read
withsection 28of the Indian Income-tax Act,1922, a penalty
may  be	 imposed  for a total failure  to  comply  with	 the
provisions ofSection 18A(3)of the said Act ?"
The reference was heard by Bhandari, C. J., and Falshaw, J.,
who  agreed  with  the Tribunal that the  conditions  as  to
notice	laid down ins. 22(1)ors. 22(2)must be  satisfied
even  when  action  was sought to be taken unders.  28in
respect	 of a failure to comply withs. 18A(3), and that  as
those conditions had not been satisfied, the order  imposing
penalty	 was bad.  The appellant applied for  a	 certificate
unders. 66A(2)of the Act, and the same was  granted,	 and
that is how the appeal comes before us.The sole question that arises for our determination in this
appeal is whether unders. 28(1)read withs.	  18A(9)of
the  Act, it is competent to the Income-tax  authorities  to
impose	a penalty on a person who has failed to comply	with
s. 18A(3) of the Act.  In answering it in the negative,	 the
learned	 Judges	 in the court below were  influenced  almost
exclusively  by the terms ofs. 28which they held  did	 not
cover-	failure	 to comply withs. 18A(3).   Now,s.  28(1)provides for penalty being imposed in three classes of cases
which are mentioned respectively in cls. (a), (b). and	(c).
Clause (b) deals with cases where there has been failure399to produce documents or accounts or other evidence which the
assessee  had been required to produce unders. 22(4)ors.
23(2)of the Act, and that is not relevant for the  purpose
of  the	 present discussion.  Then, there are cls.  (a)	 and(c), and they have reference, stating it in plain  language,
cl.  (a) to failure to make a return and cl. (c)  to  making
false  return.	Now, the learned Judges observe that  if  an
estimate of the tax is furnished unders. 18A(3)and that is
deliberately  inaccurate, that will fall under	s.  28(1)(c)
read  withs. 18A(9)(a) and penalty could be imposed  under
that section, but that that could not be done when there  is
failure to furnish an estimate as required bys. 18A(3), be-
cause  sub-s.  (1) ofs. 28would apply only when  a  person
failed to furnish the return when he had been required to do
so  by	notice unders. 22(1)ors. 22(2)ors. 34,  or	 had
failed	to  furnish it within the time allowed	and  in	 the
manner	required by the notice, and that there could  be  no
such  notice with reference tos. 18A(3).  Say	the  learned
Judges:"  In	the  first  place, a person who	 fails	to  send  an
estimate undersection 18A(3)cannot be said to have  failed
to  furnish  the  return of his total income  which  he	 was
required  to  furnish in response to a notice  issued  undersection	 22orsection 34; secondly, the said person  cannot
be  said  to  have failed to furnish  it.  within  the	time
allowed	 and  in the manner required by	 such  notice,	for,
estimates undersection 18A(3)must be furnished before	 the
15th  March in the financial year immediately preceding	 the
year  of  assessment  whereas the returns  required  by	 the
notices	 undersections 22and34can be furnished at  later
dates."With respect, the error in this reasoning lies in this	that
it  fails to give due effect to the fiction contained ins.
18A(9)(b)of  the  Act.   Under  that	provision,  when  an
assessee  has failed to comply withs. 18A(3)he " shall  be
deemed	to  have failed to furnish the return of  his  total
income	and the provisions ofsection 28, so far as may	 be,
shall  'apply  accordingly."  In other	words'	by  a  legal
fiction the failure to send an estimate of the tax unders.
18A(3)is treated as a400failure	 to furnish return of income unders. 22.  It  is  a
necessary  implication of this fiction that the estimate  of
tax  on	 the income to be submitted unders. 18A(3)is,  in
fact, different from the return to be furnished unders. 22,
and to appreciate the full significance of this fiction,  it
is necessary to examine what the distinction is.  Unders. 3of the Act, the tax is payable on the income of the previous
year.	A  statement of that income can	 be  furnished	only
after that year ends, ands. 22enacts provisions as to when
it is to be furnished in the assessment year.	Sub-sections
(1) and (2) provide for notices being given and the assessee
is  required  to  file his statement of	 income	 within	 the
period	provided therein, and it is this statement  that  is
termed	" return ".Section 18A(3), however, relates to	 the
sending	 of  a	statement  of  tax  on	the  income  of	 the
accounting  year before the 15th day of March of  that	year
itself,	 and  that statement is termed not a return  but  an
estimate,  and quite rightly, because in the very nature  of
it,  it	 can only be that.  A person who sends	an  estimate
unders. 18A(3)has also to send a return of his income	 for
the accounting year unders. 22, and sub-ss. (4) and (5)  of
s.  18A provide for adjustment of advance tax paid unders.
18A(3)towards	 the tax as finally computed  unders.	 23.
Thus,  there  is  a clear distinction between  a  return  of
income	unders. 22, which can only be during the  year  of
assessment and an estimate of tax on income unders. 18A(3),
which can only be in the year of account.It  is in the light of this distinction that the  effect  of
the legal fiction enacted ins. 18A(9) (b) that when a person
fails  to  send an estimate of tax on his  income  unders.
18A(3)he shall be deemed to have failed to furnish  return
of  his	 income,  will have to be  judged.   The  respondent
contends that its effect is only to place the estimate to be
sent unders. 18A(3)on the same footing as the return under
s. 22 for purposes ofs. 28, and that that does not abrogate
the  other  conditions laid down in that  section  on  which
alone action could be taken thereunder and penalty  imposed,
and one of those conditions is the issue of notice unders.
22(1)ors.    22(2).	But it must be noted thats.  18A(9)(b) does401not  merely  say that an estimate underS. 18A(3)shall  be
deemed	to be a return.	 It enacts that the failure to	send
an estimate in accordance withs. 18A(3)is to be deemed  to
be a failure to make a return.	Now, there can be no failure
to  make  a return, unless notice had been issued  unders.
22(1)ors. 22(2)and there has been a default in  complying
with  that notice.  Therefore, the fiction that the  failure
to send an estimate is to be deemed to be a failure to	send
a  return necessarily involves the fiction that	 notice	 had
been  issued  unders. 22, and that had	 not  been  complied
with.	It is a rule of interpretation well settled that  in
construing  the scope of a legal fiction it would be  proper
and even necessary to assume all those facts on which  alone
the   fiction	can  operate.	The   following	  off-quoted
observations of Lord Asquith in East End Dwellings Co.	Ltd.
v.  Finsbury  Borough  Council	(1)  may  appropriately	  be
referred to:"  If you are bidden to treat an imaginary state of  affairs
as  real, you must surely, unless prohibited from doing	 so,
also  imagine as real the consequences and incidents  which,
if  the putative state of affairs had in fact existed,	must
inevitably have flowed from or accompanied it.	One of these
in  this case is emancipation from the 1939 level of  rents.
The  statute says that you must imagine a certain  state  of
affairs; it does not say that having done so, you must cause
or  permit your imagination to boggle when it comes  to	 the
inevitable corollaries of that state of affairs."
The  fiction unders. 18A(9)(b) therefore that	 failure  to
send  an  estimate unders. 18A(3)is to be deemed to  be  a
failure	 to send a return must mean that all those facts  on
which alone there could be a failure to send the return must
be deemed to exist, and it must accordingly be taken that by
reason	of  this fiction, the notices required to  be  given
unders. 22must be deemed to have been given, and in	that
view,s. 28would apply on its own terms.Some  argument was addressed to us based on the use  of	 the
definite article "the" qualifying the word
(1)  [1952] A.C. 109, 132.51402"return" ins. 18-A(9)(b).  It was said that that expression
meant the - return which is to be furnished under ofs.	 22,
and  that that requires that there must have been  a  notice
issued	unders. 22(1)ors. 22(2), before action  could  be
taken  unders. 28.  In the view expressed above  that	 the
fiction	 enacted ins. 18-A(9)(b)involves the fiction	that
notices	 had  been issued unders. 22(1)ors.	22(2),	this
contention does not call for further consideration.
It  was finally argued that a fiscal statute and  especially
one  imposing  a penalty, should be strictly  construed	 and
that  if  the  words of the enactment  be  not	sufficiently
explicit  to reach the subject, the Revenue must  fail,	 and
the  following observations in Vestey's (Lord) Executors  v.
Inland	Revenue Commissioners (1) were relied on in  support
of this position :"Parliament in its attempts to keep pace with the  ingenuity
devoted	 to  tax avoidance may fall short  of  its  purpose.
That  is a -misfortune for the taxpayers who do not  try  to
avoid  their share of the burden and it is disappointing  to
the  Inland  Revenue.  But the court. will not	stretch	 the
terms of taxing Acts in order to: improve on the efforts  of
Parliament  and	 to  stop gaps which are left  open  by	 the
statutes.   Tax	 avoidance is an evil, but it would  be	 the
beginning  of  much  greater evils if  the  courts  were  to
overstretch the language of the statute in order to  subject
to taxation people of whom they disapproved."
These observations would be in, point if the language of the
enactment  left us in any doubt as to what  the	 legislature
meant.	 But can that be said ofs. 18-A(9)(b)?	 Its  object
avowedly  is to assimilate the position of a person who	 has
failed	to send the estimate unders. 18-A3) to that  of  a
person	who has failed to furnish the return.. unders.	 22,
and  that object is sought to. be achieved by  enacting	 the
fiction	 which is contained ins. 18-A(9)(b).  And  'if,  on
the  principles laid down in East End Dwellings Co. Ltd.  v.
Finsbury  Boorough  Council  (2), the true  effect  of	that
fiction is that it imports that notice had been issued under
s.  22, then the conditions prescribed ins. 28of  the	 Act
are satisfied and
(1) [1949] 1 All E.R. 1108, 1120.(2) [1952] A.C. 109, 132.403penalty	 could be imposed under that section for failure  to
comply	withs.  18-A(3), on the  clear  language  of	that
enactment itself without straining or overstretching it.
We  must  now  refer to an aspect  of  the  question,  which
strongly  reinforces  the conclusion stated above.   On	 the
construction contended for by the respondent,s.  18-A(9)(b)would  become  wholly nugatory, asss. 22(1)and22(2)can
have  no  application to advance estimates to  be  furnished
unders. 18-A(3), and if we accede to this  contention,  we
must hold that though the legislature enacteds.  18-A(9)(b)with  the  very	 object	 of bringing  the  failure  to	send
estimates unders. 18-A(3)within the operation ofs. 28, it
signally failed to achieve its object.	A construction which
leads  to  such	 a  result must, if  that  is  possible,  be
avoided,,  on the principle expressed in the maxim, "ut	 res
magis valeat quam pereat".  Vide Curtis v. Stovin (1) and in
particular the following observations of Fry, L. J., at page
519 :I  "The	 only alternative construction offered to  us  would
lead  to  this	result,	 that the  plain  intention  of	 the
legislature  has  entirely  failed by  reason  of  a  slight
inexactitude in the language of the section.  If we were  to
adopt this construction, we should be construing the Act  in
order to defeat its object rather than with a view to  carry
its object into effect".Vide  also Craies on Statute Law, p. 90 and Maxwell  on	 The
Interpretation	of  Statutes, Tenth Edn., pp.  236-237.	  "A
statute	 is designed", observed Lord Dunedin in	 Whitney  v.
Commissioners  of Inland Revenue (2), "to be  workable,	 and
the  interpretation thereof by a court should be  to  secure
that  object,  unless crucial omission	or  clear  direction
makes that end unattainable".We  are accordingly of opinion that it was competent to	 the
Income-tax authorities to impose a penalty unders. 28read
withs. 18-A(9)(b)where there has been a failure to  comply
withs. 18-A(3).in  the result., we set aside the order of the	court  below
and answer the reference in the affirmative.
