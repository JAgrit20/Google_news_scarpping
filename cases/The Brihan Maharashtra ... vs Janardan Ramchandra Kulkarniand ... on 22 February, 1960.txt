HEADNOTE:
The respondent had made an application unders. 53-COf	 the
Companies Act, 1913, with an alternative prayer for  winding
up  against  the appellant company, to the  District  judge,
Poona,	who  had been authorised under the Act	to  exercise
jurisdiction.	 While	the  application  was  pending	 theCompanies  Act,	 1913, was repealed by	theCompanies	Act,
1956.	The  appellant	company	 thereupon  applied  to	 the
District judge to dismiss the application on the ground that
he  had	 ceased to have any jurisdiction to  deal  with	 the
application on the repeal of theCompanies ActOf 1913.
Held,  thats. 6of the General Clauses Act  preserved	 the
jurisdiction  of  the  District	 judge	to  deal  with	 the
application  underS. 153-COf the Indian Companies  Act  Of
1913, notwithstanding the repeal of that Act.Section 647of the Companies Act, 1956 did not indicate	 any
intention  to affect the rights under theIndian  Companies
Actof 19I3, fors. 658of the Companies Act of 1956 mades.
6of  the General Clauses  Act	 applicable  notwithstanding
anything contained ins. 647of that Act.
86Section 24of the General Clauses Act does not put an end to
any   notification.   It  does	not  therefore	cancel	 the
notification  issued under theIndian Companies Actof	I9I3
in so far as that notification empowered the District  judge
to  exercise  jurisdiction  under s.  153-C  of	 the  Indian
Companies  Act	of  I9I3  even though unders.	 10of	 the
Companies  Act	of 1956, a District judge can no  longer  be
empowered  to exercise jurisdiction under (a)sections	1397to407of the Companies Act, 1956, which correspond  to  S.
I53-C Of the Indian Companies Act, 19I3 or (b) in respect of
the winding up of a company with a paid up share capital  of
not  less  than Rs. 1,00,000/- which the  appellant  company
was.



JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 513 of 1958.
       Appeal  by special leave from the judgment and  order  dated
       November 20, 1957, of the Bombay High Court in First  Appeal
       No. 600 of 1956, arising out of the judgment and order dated
       October	17,  1956, of the District Judge, Poona,  in  Misc.
       Petition No. 2 of 1956.H.   D.	Banaji, S. N. Andley, J. B.  Dadachanji,  Rameshwar
       Nath and P. L. Vohra, for the appellant.A.   V.	Viswanatha Sastri, Sorab N. Vakil, B. K.  B.  Naidu
       and I. N. Shroff, for respondents Nos.  1 and 2.
       1960.   February,  22.	The  Judgment  of  the	Court	was
       delivered by
       SARKAR, J.-Respondents Nos.  I to 4 are shareholders in	the
       company	which is the appellant in this case.  They made	 an
       application against the appellant and its directors unders.
       153-Cof  the  Companies  Act, 1913  before  that  Act	was
       repealed	 on  April 1, 1956, as hereinafter  mentioned,	for
       certain	reliefs which it is not necessary to  state.This
       Actwill  be  referred	to  as	the  Act  of  1913.    This
       application had been made to the Court of the District Judge
       of  Poona  which	 Court	had  been  empowered  to   exercise
       jurisdiction under the Act of 1913 by a notification  issued
       by  the	Government  of Bombay unders. 3(1)of	 that  Act.
       Before the application could be disposed of by the  District
       Judge, Poona, the Act of 1913 was repealed and re-enacted on
       April  1, 1956, by theCompanies Actof 1956, which will	 be
       referred to as the Act of 1956.On or about June 28, 1956, the appellant made an application
       to  the District Judge of Poona for an order dismissing	the
       application unders. 153-Cof the87Act of 1913 on the ground that on the repeal of that Act the
       Court had ceased to have jurisdiction to deal with it.	The
       District	 Judge	of Poona dismissed this	 application.	The
       appellants  appeal to the High Court of Bombay against  this
       dismissal also failed.  Hence the present appeal.Section	644of the Act of 1956 repeals the Act of 1913	and
       certain	other legislation relating to companies.Sections
       645to657of	 the Act of  1956  contain  various  saving
       provisions.    Mr.  Banaji  appearing  for   the	  appellant
       contended  that the proceeding before the District Judge	 of
       Poona  unders. 153-Cof the Act of 1913 had not been  saved
       by any of these provisions.  We do not consider it necessary
       to pronounce on this question for it seems to us clear  that
       that  proceeding can be continued in spite of the repeal	 of
       the Act of 1913 in view ofs. 6of the General Clauses  Act.Section 658of the Act of 1956 expressly provides that, "The
       mention	of particular matters inss. 645to657or  in	any
       other provision of this Act shall not prejudice the  general
       application  of s.6 of theGeneral Clauses Act, 1897  (X	 of
       1.897),	with respect to the effect of repeals." Mr.  Banaji
       said thats. 658had been enacted ex abundante cautela.	 Be
       it  so.Section 6of the General Clauses Act none the  less
       remains applicable with respect to the effect of the  repeal
       of the Act of 1913.Section 6of the General Clauses Act provides that where	 an
       Act is repealed, then, unless a different intention appears,
       the repeal shall not affect any right or liability  acquired
       or  incurred  under  the repealed  enactment  or	 any  legal
       proceeding  in  respect of such right or liability  and	the
       legal  proceeding may be continued as, if the repealing	Act
       had  not been passed.  There is no dispute thats. 153-Cof
       the Act of 1913 gave certain rights to the shareholders of a
       company and put the company as also its directors and manag-
       ing agents under certain liabilities.  The application under
       that  section  was  for	enforcement  of	 these	rights	and
       liabilities.Section  6of the General Clauses	 Act  would
       therefore preserve the rights and liabilities created bys.
       153-Cof the Act of 1913 and a continuance of the proceeding
       in respect thereof would be88competent in spite of the repeal of the Act of 1913,  unless
       of course a different intention would be gathered.
       Now  it	has been held by this Court inState of	 Punjab	 v.
       Mohar  Singh(1) thats. 6applies even where the  repealing
       Act  contains fresh legislation on the same subject  but	 in
       such a case one would have to look to the provisions of	the
       new  Act	 for  the  purposes  of	 determining  whether  they
       indicate	 a different intention.The Actof 1956  not  only
       repeals the Act of 1913 but contains other fresh legislation
       on  the matters enacted by the Act of 1913.  It was  further
       observed	 inState  of Punjab v. Mohar Singh(1)  that	 in
       trying to ascertain whether there is a contrary intention in
       the  new	 legislation, " the line of enquiry  would  be	not
       whether	the  new Act expressly keeps &live old	rights	and
       liabilities but whether it manifests an intention to destroy
       them."The question then is whether the Act of 1956 indicates  that
       it was intended thereby to destroy the rights created bys.
       153-Cof the Act of 1913.  Mr. Banaji said thats.  647of
       the Act of 1956 indicates an intention to destroy the rights
       created	bys. 153-Cof the Act of 1913.  We  find  nothing
       there  to  support this view.  That section only	 says  that
       where  the  winding  up of a company  commences	before	the
       commencement of the Act of 1956, the company shall be  wound
       up as if that Act had not been passed, buts. 555(7)of	the
       Act  of 1956 will apply in respect of moneys paid  into	the
       Companies  Liquidation Account.	All that this section  does
       is to make the provisions of the repealed Act applicable	 to
       the  winding up notwithstanding the repeal.  The	 provisions
       ofs. 555(7)need not be referred to as they do not  affect
       the  question.Section 647of the Act	of  1956  therefore
       indicates  no intention that the rights created bys.  153-Cof  the Act of 1913 shall be destroyed.	Nor is an  argument
       tenable that since bys. 647the Act of 1956 expressly makes
       the repealed Act applicable to a winding up commenced  under
       it,  it	impliedly  indicates  that  in	other  matters	the
       repealed	 Act cannot be resorted to, for, in view ofs.	658of the Act of 1956,
       (1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 89389the  mention  of	 a particular matter ins.  647would	not
       prejudice  the  application ofs. 6of the  General  Clauses
       Act;  in other words, nothing ins. 647is to be	 understood
       as indicating an intention thats. 6of the General  Clauses
       Act  is	not to apply.  On the other hand, the  parties	are
       agreed  that the provisions ofs. 153-Cof the Act  of  1913
       have  been substantially re-enacted by the Act of  1956	and
       this  would indicate an intention not to destroy the  rights
       created bys. 153-C.Mr.  Banaji then drew our attention tos. 10of the  Act	 of
       1956  ands. 24of the General Clauses Act.Section  10of
       the  Act of 1956 corresponds tos. 3of the Act of 1913	and
       deals  with  the jurisdiction of Courts.	 Under	s.  10	the
       Central Government may empower a District Court to  exercise
       jurisdiction  under  the	 Act, not  being  the  jurisdiction
       conferred  among others byss. 397to407nor in respect	 of
       the winding up of companies with a paid up share capital	 of
       not less than Rs. 1,00,000.Sections 397to407of the	Act
       of  1956, it is agreed, contain' substantially  the  provis-
       sions  ofs. 153-Cof the Act of 1913.	It has also  to	 be
       stated  that  the paid up capital of the appellant  is  more
       than Rs. 1,00,000 and the application unders. 153-Cof	the
       Act  of 1913 contained a prayer in the alternative  for	the
       winding	up  of the appellant.Section 24of  the  General
       Clauses Act provides that where any Act is repealed and	re-
       enacted	with or without modifications, then, unless  it	 is
       otherwise expressly provided, any notification issued  under
       the  repealed  Act shall, so far as it is  not  inconsistent
       with  the  provisions re-enacted, continue in force  and	 be
       deemed  to  have	 been issued under the	provisions  so	re-
       enacted unless and until it is superseded by a  notification
       issued under those provisions..Mr.  Banaji points out that in view ofs. 10of the  Act	 of
       1956  a	District Court can no longer be empowered  to  deal
       with  an application of the kind made to the District  Judge
       of  Poona, as that application asks for reliefs	similar	 to
       those contemplated byss. 397to407of the Act of 1956	and
       also  asks  for the winding up of a company  whose  paid	 up
       capital exceeds Rs. 1,00,000 and power to deal with such an90application  cannot now be given to a District  Court.	He,
       therefore,  says that the notification issued under the	Act
       of 1913 empowering the District Judge of Poona to deal  with
       the  application would be inconsistent in this respect  with
       the  provisions of the Act of 1956 and could not in view	 ofs.  24of the General Clauses Act be deemed to  continue	 in
       force  after  the repeal of the Act of 1913.   Hence  it	 is
       contended that the notification has ceased to have any force
       and the District Judge of Poona has no longer any  jurisdic-
       tion  to	 hear the application.	It is also said	 that  this
       shows  that  the	 Act  of 1956  indicates  that	the  rights
       acquired	 under the Act of 1913 would come to an end on	its
       repeal.We  are unable to accept these contentions.Section  10of
       the Act of 1956 deals only with the jurisdiction of  courts.
       It shows that the District Courts can no longer be empowered
       to  deal with applications under the Act of 1956 in  respect
       of  matters  contemplated bys. 153-Cof the  Act  of  1913.
       This  does not indicate that the rights created bys.  153-Cof  the	Act of 1913 were intended to be destroyed.   As	 we
       have earlier pointed out fromState of Punjab v. Mohar Singh(1),  the contrary intention in the repealing Act must  show
       that  the  rights  under the old Act  were  intended  to	 be
       destroyed in order to prevent the application ofs.  6of
       the General Clauses Act.	 But it is said thats.	 24of	the
       General	Clauses Act puts an end to the notification  giving
       power  to the District Judge, Poona to hear the	application
       unders. 153-Cof the Act of 1913 as that  notification	 is
       inconsistent withs. 10of the Act of 1956 and the  District
       Judge cannot, therefore, continue to deal with the  applica-
       tion.Section 24does not however purport to put an end	 to
       any  notification.   It	is not intended	 to  terminate	any
       notification;  all it does is to continue a notification	 in
       force in the stated circumstances after the Act under  which
       it  was issued, is repealed.Section 24therefore does	not
       cancel  the  notification empowering the District  Judge	 of
       Poona  to exercise jurisdiction under the Act of	 l9l3.	 It
       seems to us that since unders. 6of the General Clauses Act
       the proceeding in respect of the application unders. 153-C(1)  [1955] I S.C.R. 89391of the Act of 1913 may be continued after the repeal of that
       Act,  it follows that the District Judge of Poona  continues
       to  have	 jurisdiction to entertain it. If it were  not	so,
       thens. 6would become infructuous.For these reasons we think that the appeal must fail and	 it
       is therefore dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed.
