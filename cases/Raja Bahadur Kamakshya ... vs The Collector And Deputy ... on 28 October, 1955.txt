HEADNOTE:
On  the 29th of December, 1947, petitioner No. 1 executed  a
lease  to C (a company) of certain properties consisting  of
lands  and  buildings comprised in the estate  belonging  to
him.  Subsequently, in 1949 he executed a deed of settlement
whereby	 he  transferred the properties to  three  trustees,
namely, himself and petitioners 2 and 3. Bihar Land  Reforms
Act,  1950(Bihar ActXXX of 1950) came into force  on	 the
25th  of September, 1950, and on the 3rd of November,  1951,
the  State of Bihar issued a notification unders.  3(1)of
the  Act declaring that the estate of petitioner  No. 1	 had
passed to and become vested in the State.  A notice unders.
4(h)of the Act was issued by the Collector to C and on	 the
4th of	  March,   1954,  the  State  Government  issued   a
notification  under s.3(1) purporting to vest in  the  State
the  properties	 in  question.	It  was	 contended  for	 the
petitioners   that  the	 buildings  standing  on  the	land
comprised in the notified estate did not vest in the  State,
on  the ground (1) that the estate of the petitioner  No.  1
did  not  vest	in the State unders. 3of the	Act  but  by
virtue of the provisions ofs. 4, (2) that the definition of
"estate"  -in  the Act speaks of land only and	not  of	 any
building  on  it,  (3)	that on the  date  of  vesting,	 the
buildings  were	 not  used as office  or  cutchery  for	 the
collection of rent of the notified estate within the meaning
ofs.	4(a),  and  (4) thats.	 4(h)is  ultra  vires	 the
Constitution  as it imposes an unreasonable  restriction  on
the  fundamental  right of the petitioners to  realise	rent
from the company.
Held, that (1) whether the estate of petitioner No. I vested
in   the  State	 by  reason  of	 the  publication   of	 the
notification unders. 3or by virtue of the provisions ofs.
4was of little consequence as in either case a vesting took
place;
(2)  although in the definition of "estate" the word land is
used  and  there  is no mention of the	word  building,	 the
provisions  of	ss.  4, 5 and 7 show the  intention  of	 the
legislature to include some-
989
thing  more  than merely the land of a	notified  estate  as
vesting in the State.  Unders. 4(a), buildings of a certain
description and other things vest in the State absolutely on
the  publication of a notification unders. 3. Underss.  5and7,	 the buildings mentioned therein are  deemed  to  be
settled	 by the State with the intermediary and	 this  could
only be an the supposition that the buildings vested in	 the
State, the intermediary being a settlee under the State;
(3)ss.  4(a)and4(h)must be read together.   Unders.
4(h), the use to which the building was put previous to	 its
transfer  after	 the  first day of January,  1946,  and	 not
thereafter was what the Collector was concerned with and not
to  what  use it had been put after its transfer  after	 the
first  day of January, 1946.  If a transfer was	 made  after
the  first day of January, 1946 of a building  comprised  in
the  notified estate which was used immediately previous  to
the date of transfer primarily as office or cutchery for the
collection  of	rent of such estate the	 transfer  would  be
liable	to be annulled unders. 4(h)and the building  would
vest  absolutely  in  the State on the	publication  of	 the
notification  and  the provisions ofs. 4(a)must  be	read
accordingly; and
(4)  the Collector's powers unders. 4(h), wide as they are,
are  not  quite so absolute or arbitrary as  suggested.	  S.
4(h)  is a part of a validly enacted law of  acquisition  of
estates	 and is an integral part of the machinery  by  which
acquisition of an estate takes place.The Actors. 4(h)of
it imposing any unreasonable restriction on the	 fundamental
right  of the petitioners, therefore, does not	&rise.The
Actincludings. 4(h)of it, is protected byArt.  31-Aof
the Constitution.



JUDGMENT:ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Petition No. 217 of
1955.Underarticle	32of the Constitution	 of  India  for	 the
enforcement of Fundamental Rights.N.   C.	 Chatterjee, (Vir Sen Sawhney and Ganpat  Rai,	with
him), for the petitioners.Lal Narain Sinha, (Bajrang Sahai and S. P. Verma, with him),
for respondent No. 2.1955.  October 28.  The Judgment of the Court was  delivered
by
IMAM  J.-The petitioners have filed this  application  underarticle	 32of the Constitution claiming that the  buildings
and lands as set out in the Schedule annexed to the petition
and  marked  "A" (hereinafter referred to  as  the  disputed
properties)  did  not vest in the State of Bihar  under	 the
provisions of the990Bihar Land Reforms Act 1950 (hereinafter referred to as	 the
Act).	Petitioner No. I in his individual capacity  was  at
one  time  the owner, of the disputed properties  which	 lie
within	Touzi No. 28 of the Collectorate of Hazaribagh.	  On
the 29th of December, 1947 petitioner No. I as owner  leased
out  the disputed properties to a Company known	 as  Mineral
Development  Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the  Company).
The  Company took possession of the disputed properties	 and
has been paying rent.  On the 7th of April, 1949  petitioner
No.  I	in  his	 individual  capacity  executed	 a  deed  of
settlement whereby he transferred the disputed properties to
three trustees, namely, himself and petitioners 2 and 3. The
Company	 has  been paying rent to the trustees	since  then.The Actcame into force on the 25th of September, 1950.	  On
the  3rd  of November, 1951 the State  Government  issued  a
notification  undersection 3(1)of the Act  declaring	that
the  estate of petitioner No. I in his	individual  capacity
specified  therein  had passed to and become vested  in	 the
State.	On the 26th of October, 1953 a notice undersection
4(h)of the Act was issued by the Collector to the  Company,
and on the 4th of March, 1954 the State Government issued  a
notification  undersection 3(1)of the Act  purporting  to
vest  in  the  State the properties covered  by	 the  above-
mentioned deed of settlement and another deed of  settlement
with which we are' not concerned.  The Company instituted  a
title suit No. 33 of 1951 against the State of Bihar in	 the
Court of the Subordinate Judge, Hazaribagh basing its  claim
on  a  mining  lease executed by petitioner  No.  I  in	 his
individual capacity the genuineness of which was  challenged
by  the State.	Petitioner No. I in his individual  capacity
was made a party to this suit.	The Company also  instituted
a  title  suit No. 9 of 1954 against the State of  Bihar  to
which petitioner No. I in his individual capacity was made a
party challenging the legality of the issue of notice  dated
26-10-1953  undersection 4(h)of the Act.  On the  11th  of
November, 1954 the State of Bihar filed title suit No, 53 of
1954 to which the Company,991petitioner  No.	 I  in his individual  capacity,  the  three
trustees  and  others were made parties.  By this  suit	 the
State  of Bihar challenged the genuineness of the  lease  in
favour	of the Company and the deed of settlement in  favour
of the trustees.The  real question for determination is, what vested in	 the
State on the publication of the notification undersection 3and by virtue of the provisions ofsection 4(a)of the	Act?
According to Mr. Chatterjee the disputed properties did	 not
vest in the State, whatever else may have.  Having regard to
the definition of "estate" in the Act, if anything vested in
the  State on the publication of a notification it  was	 the
land  comprised	 in  the  notified  estate.   Although	 the
disputed  properties  stood  on the  land  in  the  notified
estate,	 they  did  not	 vest  in  the	State,	because	 the
definition  of "estate" speaks of land only and not  of	 any
building on it.	 The notification undersection 3was a mere
declaration  and  actual vesting took  place  undersection
4(a).	On the date of vesting the disputed properties	were
not used as office or cutchery for the collection of rent of
the notified estate of petitioner No. 1, who had parted with
his  right, title, and interest therein long before the	 Act
was  enacted and the publication of the	 notification  under
section:  3. Mr. Sinha on behalf of the State of  Bihar,  on
the  other hand, contended that on a perusal of	 the  provi-
sions  ofsections 4,5and7of the Act, it  would  appear
that  the Act contemplated something more than the' land  in
an estate vesting in the State and the disputed'  properties
could  and did vest in the State on the publication  of	 the
notification undersection 3.In  our opinion, it is of little consequence in the  present
case  whether  the notified estate vested in  the  State  by
reason of the publication of the notification undersection
3or by virtue of the provisions ofsection 4of  the	Act,
because	 in either case a vesting did take place.   Although
the  word  land is used in the definition of  "estate",	 the
provisions  ofsections  4,5and7show  the  necessary
intention  to include something more than the land  when  an
estate	vests  in the State.  Undersection 4(a)it  is	 not
only the992estate but also buildings of a certain description and other
things which vest in the State absolutely on the publication
of  a notification undersection 3. Undersections 5and7the  buildings	mentioned therein also vest  in	 the  State,
because	 the buildings in question are deemed to be  settled
by  the	 State with the intermediary  in  possession.	This
could only be on the supposition that these buildings vested
in  the State and the person in possession held the same  as
settlee under the State.In  the present case on the date of the publication  of	 the
notification  undersection 3the disputed  properties	were
said  to be in the possession of the Company as	 lessee	 and
the petitioner No. I had no right, title or interest therein
as he had transferred his lessor's reversion to trustees  by
a deed of settlement.  We may assume, therefore, that on the
date  of  publication  of  the	notification  the   disputed
properties were not used primarily as office or cutchery for
the collection of rent of the notified estate of  petitioner
No.  1	It. becomes, therefore, necessary to  interpret	 the
word "used" occurring insection 4(a).	It is to be  noticed
that this clause ofsection 4does not expressly state	that
a  building  used primarily as office or  cutchery  for	 the
collection  of	rent  must be so used at  the  date  of	 the
publication  of the notification.  In this clause the  words
"used primarily as office or cutchery for the collection  of
rent  of  such	estate" must be read in the  light.  of	 the
provisions ofsection 4(h)where similar words are employed.
Under  section	4(h)  the Collector has the  power  to	make
inquiries in respect of any transfer of any kind of interest
in any building used primarily as office or cutchery for the
collection of rent of such estate, if the transfer had	been
made  at any time after the first day of January, 1946.	  If
on due inquiry the Collector is satisfied that such transfer
was  made with the object of defeating he provisions of	 the
Act  or	 causing  loss	to the	State  or  obtaining  higher
compensation, then the Collector may, after giving notice to
the parties concerned and hearing them and with the previous
sanction  of  she State Government, annul the  transfer	 and
dis-993possess	 the  person claiming under  it.   These  provisions
clearly indicate that if any building was used primarily  as
office	or  cutchery  for the collection of  rent  and	such
building  had  been  transferred  after	 the  first  day  of
January,  1946,	 the  transfer	could  be  annulled  if	 the
circumstances	mentioned   insection   4(h)had	been
established.   That is to say, under.' these provisions	 the
use  to which the building was put previous to its  transfer
after the first day of January, 1946 and not thereafter	 was
what the Collector was concerned with and not to what use it
had  been  put	after its transfer after the  first  day  of
January,  1946.	  To  hold otherwise would be  to  make	 the
provisions  ofsection 4(h)meaningless.  When a  proprietor
transfers any such building' it necessarily follows that the
building  thereafter  was  not	used by	 him  as  office  or
cutchery  for the collection of rent of his estate.  If	 the
transfer was made before the first day of January, 1946	 the
provisions  ofsection	 4(h)would not	 apply	and  such  a
transfer would not be liable to be annulled and the building
so  transferred would not vest in the State on the  date  of
the  publication of the notification covering the estate  on
which  such  building stands.  If, on the other	 hand,	this
transfer  was made after the first day of January,  1946,  a
building  comprised  in a notified estate,  which  was	used
immediately  previous to the date of the transfer  primarily
as  office  or cutchery for the collection of rent  of	such
estate	the  transfer would be liable to be  annulled  undersection	 4(h)and it would vest absolutely in the  State  on
the  publication of the notification and the  provisions  ofsection	 4(a)must  be	 read  accordingly.   It  would	  be
unreasonable  to construe the provisions ofsection 4(a)in
the way suggested by Mr. Chatterjee.  The scheme of the	 Act
has to be borne in mind and the provisions ofsections	4(a)and4(h)have to be read together.  The petitioners had	 not
asserted in their petition that the disputed properties were
not used as office or cutchery for the collection of rent of
the notified estate of petitioner No. I before the first  of
January, 1946 or before the lease in favour of the  Company.
On behalf994of  the	 State, on affidavit, it has been  stated  that	 the
disputed  properties were all along used as cutchery  before
the creation of the lease and that they were not being	used
in connection with any mining operation.  In our opinion, if
as  a result of the inquiry undersection 4(h)the  transfer
of  the	 disputed  properties by the  petitioner  No.  I  is
annulled the disputed properties must be regarded as  having
vested	in  the State, because they were used as  office  or
cutchery  for  the  collection	of  rent  previous  to	 the
transfers made by the petitioner No. 1.It  was next contended thatsection 4(h)is ultra vires	 the
Constitution, because it imposed an unreasonable restriction
on the fundamental right of the petitioners to realize	rent
from  the  Company,  as	 the  transfer	in  its	 favour	 was
imperilled  by the notice issued to it undersection  4(h).
No  appeal  or review was provided in the  Act	against	 the
order  of  the	Collector  issuing notice  or  an  order  of
annulment made by him.	The Collector was left with absolute
power  to  annul a transfer and to dispossess  a  person  in
possession  thereunder.Section 4(b), however, does  direct
the  Collector	to  give reasonable notice  to	the  parties
concerned and to bear them.  Such annulment or dispossession
which  he may order, must be with the previous	sanction  of
the  State Government and he is compelled to do so on  terms
which  may appear to him fair and equitable.  The power	 is,
therefore, not quite so absolute or arbitrary as  suggested.
Assuming, however, that the Collector has very wide  powers,
it  is to be remembered thatsection 4(h)is a part  of	 the
law  of acquisition of estates as enacted by the Act and  is
an integral part of the machinery by which acquisition of an
estate	takes place.The Actis a valid law of	 acquisition
and its whole purpose may be defeated unless there was	some
such provision as contained insection 4(b).The Actbeing
a  law	for  acquisition of estates the question  of  it  orsection 4(h)of it imposing any unreasonable restriction  on
the  fundamental rights of the petitioners does	 not  arise.
In any event the Act including sect-ton 4(h) is protected byarticle 31-Aof the Constitution.The petition is accordingly dismissed with costs.995
