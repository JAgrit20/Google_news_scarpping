HEADNOTE:
 The  appellant,  a  partnership firm, filed  its  return  of
 income	 for  the assessment year  i960-61  and	 subsequently
 produced before the Incometax Officer its relevant books  of
 accounts  and	papers.	  It also  produced  before  him  the
 statement  showing  various  creditors	 from  whom  it	  had
 borrowed  on Hundis during the accounting year in  question,
 giving	 full names and addresses of the  alleged  creditors.
 After enquiry the Incometax Officer made an assessment.   On
 June 3, 1966 the Income-tax Officer issued to the  appellant
 a  notice  unders. 148of the Income-tax  Act,  1961.	  The
 notice was issued after four years but before 8 years of the
 end   of  the	original  assessment  year.   The   appellant
 challenged  the  validity  of	the notice  as	well  as  the
 proceedings  taken on the strength of that notice in a	 writ
 petition  under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution.	  The
 High Court dismissed the petition.  By special leave  appeal
 was  filed in this Court.  On direction given by  the	Court
 the  report  submitted	 by the	 Income-tax  Officer  to  the
 Commissioner  and  the	 Commissioner's	 order	thereon	 were
 produced.   In the report it was said that it appeared	 that
 the alleged creditors of the appellant were name lenders and
 transactions	were   bogus;  hence   proper	investigation
 regarding those loans was necessary.  Question No. 8 on  the
 report	 was whether the Commissioner was satisfied that  the
 case was fit for the issue of notice unders. 148.   Against
 this the commissioner had noted 'yes'.	 On these facts	 this
 Court,
 HELD  :  Unders. 148and s. 151(2) the  Income-tax  Officer
 Must record his reasons for issuing the notice unders. 148.
 There must be prima facie grounds for taking action under s.
 148  Further before issuing such a notice the provisions  of
 cis. (a) and (b) ofs. 147must be satisfied. [447 B, E]
 In  this case the Income-tax Officer appears to have  had  a
 vague feeling that the transactions were bogus and that  the
 alleged creditors were only name lenders.  According to  him
 proper	 investigation	regarding the  loans  was  necessary.
 That is not the same thing as saying that there ,are reasons
 to issue notice unders. 148. [447 A-C]
 In these circumstances it could not be held that the Income-
 tax Officer had any material before him which could  satisfy
 the  requirements  of either cl. (a) or cl. (b) ofs.	 147.
 Therefore  he could not have issued a notice unders.	 148.
 Further the report submitted by him unders. 151(2)did  not
 mention any reason for coming to the conclusion that it  was
 a  fit case for the issue of the notice unders.  148.	  The
 Commissioner  also mechanically accorded  permission.	 Thus
 the  important safeguards provided inss. 147and151were
 lightly treated by the income-tax Officer as well as by  the
 Commissioner. [447 F-448 B]
 The appeal must accordingly be allowed.

JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 1311 of 1967.
 Appeal	 by special leave from the judgment and	 order	dated
 January 17, 1967 of the Patna High Court in C.W.J.C. No. 952
 of 1966.M.   C. Chagla, N. D. Karkhanis, S. P. Chowdhury,  Bhuvanesh
 Kumari, for the appellant.S.   C. Manchanda, R. N. Sachthey and B. D. Sharma, for  the
 respondent.The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
 Hegde,	 J.  This is an assessee's, appeal by  special	leave
 against  the judgment of the High Court of Patna  dismissing
 in  limini its writ petition under Arts 226 and 227  of  the
 Constitution of India.The  assessee	is having construction	contracts  under  the
 Railways  as  well as the Government.	It is  a  partnership
 firm.	 For  the assessment year 1960-61,  relevant  to  the
 accounting  year 1959-60, after the assessee  submitted  its
 income-tax  return, it was asked by the  Income-tax  Officer
 during	 the  income-tax assessment  proceedings  to  produce
 before	 him  its  books of account and	 the  other  relevant
 papers.   The assessee also produced before him a  statement
 showing  various  creditors  from whom it  had	 borrowed  on
 Hundis	 during	 the accounting year in	 question.   In	 that
 statement it gave the lull names and address of the  alleged
 creditors.   After enquiry, the assessee's total income  was
 assessed  at  Rs.  69,886/-.	On  June  3,  1966,  the  1st
 respondent  (Income-tax  Officer  Ward	 'A',,	 Muzaffarpur)
 issued	 to the assessee a notice unders. 148of the  Indian
 Income-tax  Act, 1961.	 The material portion of that  notice
 reads as follows
 "Notice unders. 148of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
   Income-Tax Officer, Muzaffarpur
   Dated, the 3-6-1966.TO
 M/s.  Chugamal Rajpal, Muzaffarpur.Whereas  (1)  have  reason  to	 believe  that	your   income
 chargeable  the income of 1960-1961 in respect of which  you
 are  assessable  to tax for the assessment year  19  19  has
 escaped assessment within the444meaning ofsection 147of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
 I  therefore  propose to re-assess the income for  the	 said
 assessment  year and I hereby require you to deliver  to  me
 within	 30  days from the date of service of this  notice  a
 return in the prescribed form of your income
 The income assessable relevant to the assessment year	1960-61of
 in  respect  of  which	 you are  assessable  for the  said
 assessment year.2.   The   notice  is	being  issued  after  obtaining	  the
 necessary  satisfaction  of the Commissioner  of  IncomeTax,
 Bihar and Orissa, Patna.Sd/- S. P. Chaliha
 Income-Tax Officer,
 Ward A, Muzaffarpur."The assessee challenged the validity of that notice as	 well
 as  proceedings  taken	 on the strength of  that  notice  on
 various grounds.  As we are accepting the contention of  the
 assessee that the impugned notice is invalid inasmuch as  it
 did  not  comply with the requirements ofs. 151(2)of  the
 Act,  we have not thought it necessary to examine the	other
 contentions  advanced	on behalf of the assessee.   In	 this
 case the notice was issued after four years but before eight
 years of the date of the original assessment.Section 151(2) of the Act reads
 "No  notice  shall  be issued underSection  148after  the
 expiry of four years from the end of the relevant assessment
 year,	unless the Commissioner is satisfied on	 the  reasons
 recorded by the Income-tax Officer that it is a fit case for
 the issue of such notice."Section 148prescribes :"(1)  Before  making the assessment,  re-assessment  or  re-
 computation underSection 147, the Income-tax Officer	shall
 serve	on the assesee a notice containing all or any of  the
 requirements  which may be included in a notice  under	 sub-
 section (2) ofSection 139and445the  provisions of this Act shall, so far as may  be,	apply
 accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that
 sub-section.(2)  The Income-tax Officer shall, before issuing any notice
 under this section, record his reasons for doing so. "Section 147deals with income escaping assessment.  At	 this
 stage we need not refer to that section : We shall refer  to
 that provision at a later stage.Section 139(2)says :
 "In  the case of any person who, in the incometax  Officer's
 opinion, assessable under this Act, whether on his own total
 income	 or, on the total income of any other  person  during
 the  previous year, the Income-tax Officer may,  before  the
 end of the relevant assessment year, serve a notice upon him
 requiring  him to furnish, within thirty days from the	 date
 of  service  of the notice, a return of his  income  or  the
 income of such other person during the previous year, in the
 prescribed  form and verified in the prescribed  manner  and
 setting forth such other particulars as may be prescribed."
 (proviso is not necessary for our present purpose)
 When  this appeal came up for hearing on the last  occasion,
 as we found the affidavit filed by the Income-tax Officer to
 'be  vague and indefinite, we directed the  learned  Counsel
 for  the Department to produce before us the records of  the
 Incometax  Officer to show that the, Income-tax Officer  had
 complied  with the requirements ofs. 148ands.  151(2)of
 the  Act.  When the appeal was taken up for hearing  on  the
 18th January 1971, only the report submitted by the  Income-
 tax  Officer  to  the	Commissioner and  the  order  of  the
 Commissioner  was produced.  The order sheet  recording  the
 reasons  of the Income-tax Officer as required bys.  148(2)was not produced.  Hereinbelow we have sent out the  report
 of  the  Income-tax  Officer as well as  the  order  of  the

 Sd/- S. P. Chaliha, 30-4-66.Income-tax Officer,
 A-Ward, Muzaffarpur."In  his report the Income-tax Officer does not set  out  any
 reason for coming to the conclusion that this is a fit	 case
 to  issue  notice unders. 148.  The material	that  he  had
 before him for issuing notice unders. 148is not  mentioned
 in  the report.  In his report he vaguely refers to  certain
 communications	 received by him from the C.I.T.,  Bihar  and
 Orissa.   He does not mention the facts contained  in	those
 communications.   All	that  he  says	is  that  from	those
 communications	 "it  appears  that  these  persons  (alleged
 creditors) are name lenders and the transactions are bogus".
 He has not even come to a prima facie conclusion447that  the transactions to which he referred are not  genuine
 transactions.	 He appears to have had only a vague  feeling
 that  they  may be bogus transactions.	  Such	a  conclusion
 'does	not fulfil the requirements ofs. 151(2).  What	 that
 provision requires is that he must give reasons for  issuing
 a  notice  unders. 148.  In other words he must  have	 some
 prima	facie grounds before him for taking action  under  s.148.	 Further   his	report	mentions  :   "Hence   proper
 investigation	regarding these loans is necessary  In	other
 words	 his  conclusion  is  that  there  is  a   case	  for
 investigating	as to the truth of the alleged	transactions.
 That is not the same thing as saying that there are  reasons
 to  issue,  notice unders. 148.  Before  issuing  a  notice
 under	s.  148,  the Income-tax  Officer  must	 have  either
 reasons to believe that by reason of the omission or failure
 on the part of these assessee to, make a return unders. 139for  any  assessment year to the Income-tax  Officer  or  to
 disclose  fully and truly all material facts  necessary  for
 his  assessment for that year, income chargeable to tax  has
 escaped  assessment  for  that year  or  alternatively	 not-
 withstanding  that there has been no omission or failure  as
 mentioned above on the part of the assessee, the  Income-tax
 Officer has in consequence of information in his  possession
 reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has  escaped
 assessment for any assessment year.  Unless the requirements
 of clause (a) or (b) ofs. 147are satisfied, the Income-tax
 Officer has no jurisdiction to issue a notice unders.	 148.
 From  the report submitted by the Income-tax Officer to  the
 Commissioner, it is clear that he could not have had reasons
 to  believe  that by reason of the  assessee's	 omission  to
 disclose  fully and truly all material' facts necessary  for
 his  assessment for the accounting year in question,  income
 chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year;  nor
 could it be said that he as a consequence of information  in
 his  possession,  had	reasons to believe  that  the  income
 chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year.   We
 are  not  satisfied  that the	Income-tax  Officer  had  any
 material before him which could satisfy the requirements  of
 either cl. (a) or cl. (b) ofs. 147.  Therefore he could not
 have  issued  a  notice unders. 148.	 Further  the  report
 submitted by him unders. 151(2)does not mention any reason
 for  coming to the conclusion that it is a fit case for  the
 issue of a notice unders. 148.  We are also of the  opinion
 that the Commissioner has mechanically accorded  permission.
 He  did not himself record that he was satisfied  that	 this
 was  a fit case for the issue of a notice unders. 148.   To
 Question  No.	8  in the report which	reads  "Whether	 the,
 Commissioner is satisfied that it is a case for the I	issue
 of notice undersection 148", he just noted the word "yes"
 and  affixed  his  signatures thereunder.   We	 are  of  the
 opinion  .that if only he had read the report carefully,  he
 could never have448come to the conclusion on the material before him that	 this
 is  a fit case to issue notice unders. 148.  The  important
 safeguards  provided  insections 147and151were  lightly
 treated  by  the  Income-tax  Officer	as  well  as  by  the
 Commissioner..	 Both of them, appear to have taken the	 duty
 imposed  on  them  under  those  provisions  as  of   little
 importance.	They  have  substituted	 the  form  for	  the
 substance.In the result this appeal is allowed, the order of the	 High
 Court	is  set aside and the impugned notice  quashed.	  The
 Respondent  No. 2 shall pay the costs of the appellant	 both
 in this Court and in the High Court.G.C.			       Appeal allowed.449
