C.   K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General for India (Porus A.	  Mehta
and P. G Gokhale, with him) for respondent No. 2.9561954.  March 11.  'the Judgment of the Court was
delivered by
DAS J.-The short point raised on this petition filed in this
court  underarticle 32of the Constitution is	whether	 the
Patiala	 and  East  Punjab States Union	 General  Sales	 Tax
Ordinance, 2006 (No.  XXXIII of 2006) which was	 promulgated
on the 6th November, 1949, has become void since the date of
the commencement of the Constitution.Article 286(3)of the Constitution of India runs as  follows
:-"  286.	 (3)  No  law made by the  Legislature	of  a  State
imposing,  or  authorising the imposition of, a tax  on	 the
sale or purchase of any such goods as have been declared  by
Parliament  by	law  to be essential for  the  life  of	 the
community shall have effect unless it has been reserved	 for
the  consideration  of the President and  has  received	 his
assent."The  Essential Goods (Declaration and Regulation of  Tax  on
Sale  orPurchase) Act, 1952(Central ActNo. LII  of  1952)
declared  certain commodities as essential for the  life  of
the  community.	 In the schedule appended to the Act item  8
relates to "all cloth, woven on handlooms, coarse and medium
cotton cloth made in mills or woven on power looms."Section
3of the same Act provides as follows:-"3.  Regulation	 of tax on 'sale or  purchase  of  essential
goods: No law made after the commencement of this Act by the
Legislature   of  a  State  imposing,  or  authorising	 the
imposition  of, a tax on the sale or purchase of  any  goods
declared  by this Act to be essential for the life'  of	 the
community shall have effect unless it has been reserved	 for
the  consideration  of the President and  has  received	 his
assent."The petitioners are dealers in coarse cloth and medium cloth
and  their contention is that these commodities having	been
declared  as essential, for the life of the  community	they
are not liable to pay sales tax on them.  In the petition an
allegation has been' made that section 3 of Act LII of	1952
is  in	direct	contravention  ofarticle  286(3)of	 the
Constitution.  There957does  not  appear to be any substance  in  this	 contention.Section	 3is in line witharticle 286(3)and there  is  no
inconsistency	between	 that  section	and   the   relevant
provision  of the Constitution.	 The petitioners are  sought
to be taxed under the Ordinance XXXIII of 2006, which, as an
existing  law,	has  been continued  byarticle  372.The
question   is	whether	 that  Ordinance   contravenes	 the
provisions  ofarticle 286(3)or has  since  been  altered,
repealed or amended by any competent legislative authority..
It is quite clear that section 3 of Act LII of 1952 does not
affect the Ordinance', for the Ordinance was not made  after
the commencement of that Act.  The only question, therefore,
is  whether  the  Ordinance runs counter to  clause  (8)  ofarticle	 286of the Constitution.  A perusal of that  clause
will  at  once	indicate that clause  contemplates  a  post-
Constitution  law,  for	 it  must be a	law  made  by  a  "I
Legislature of a State " which must refer to the Legislature
of  a State created by the Constitution.  Further, and	what
is  more important, it contemplates a law which can  be	 but
has not been reserved for the consideration of the President
and  has  not received his assent.  This  provision  clearly
points	to  post-Constitution  law,  for  there	 can  be  no
question  of an existing law continued byarticle 372being
reserved   for	the  consideration  of	the  President	 for
receiving   his	 assent.   As  we  are	concerned  in	this
application with a pre-Constitution law, it is not necessary
for  us	 to  express  any opinion  as  to  the	validity  or
otherwise  of  a  law made after  the  commencement  of	 the
Constitution but before the coming into operation of Act LII
of 1952.The result, therefore, is that there is no substance in this
petition and we dismiss it with costs.Petition dimissed.Agent for the petitioners: Sardar Singh.
