ACT:
Income-tax--General notice--Non-resident liability to submit

(XI of 1922), s. 22(1) & (2), s.34(1)(a) & (b).



HEADNOTE:
The appellant, a non-resident for the purposes of theIndian
Income-tax  Act, did not submit returns of certain  dividend
income	accruing to him within the taxable  territory.	 The
Income-tax Officer served upon him notices underS. 34read
withS. 22(2)of the Act for assessment of tax in respect of
those  years.	The notices in question were  issued  within
eight years from the end of the years of assessment and were
within the period prescribed bys. 34(i)(a).  The  appellant
contended  that notices for assessment were governed by	 cl.
(i)(b)	ofS.	34and not by cl. (i)(a),  even	 though	 the
appellant had not made a return of his income for the  years
in question as a general notice unders. 22(1)did not	give
rise to a liability to submit a return and his inaction	 did
not  amount to omission or failure to submit a return as  he
was  a	non-resident, and the  assessment  proceedings	were
barred by limitation.
Held,  that the expression "every person " ins. 22(1)  of
theIndian Income-tax Act, 1922, includes all	persons	 who
are  liable  to pay tax and non-residents are  not  exempted
from  liability to submit a return pursuant to	the  general
notice thereunder.
Once  a	 notice is given by publication	 in  the  prescribed
manner unders. 22(i), every person whether resident or non-
resident whose income exceeds the maximum amount exempt from
tax is obliged to submit a return and if he does not do so,
36
it  will  be deemed that there was omission on his  part  to
make  a	 return	 within the meaning ofS.  34(i)(a)of	 the
Indian	Income	tax Act.Section 34(1)(b)applied  only  to
those cases where there was no omission or failure to make a
return	of the income or to make a full and true  disclosure
of facts material to the  assessment.
In the instant case the proceedings for assessment were pro-
perly  commenced within the period of limitation  prescribed
bys. 34(1)(a).



JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 408 of 1957.
Appeal	by Special Leave from the Judgment and	Order  dated
the 28th September, 1955, of the former Bombay High Court in
Income-tax Reference No. 5 of 1955.Sanat  P. Mehta, S. N.	Andley, J. B. Dadachanji,  Rameshwar
Nath and P. L. Vohra, for the appellant.A.   N.	 Kripal,  R.  H.  Dhebar  and  D.  Gupta,  for	 the
respondent.1960.  October 18.  The Judgment of the Court was  delivered
by
SHAH  J.-To  the appellant who was a  non-resident  for	 the
purposes of theIndian Income Tax Act, 1922, had accrued  in
the  assessment years 1943-44, 194445, 1946-47	and  1947-48
certain	 dividend  income within the  taxable  territory  of
British	 India, but the appellant did not submit returns  of
his  income for those assessment years.	 In exercise of	 his
powers	unders. 34of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922,	 the
Income	Tax Officer, Bombay City, served upon the  appellant
notices	 under	s.  34 read with s, 22(2)  of  the  Act	 for
assessment of tax in respect of those years.  The notice for
the  year 1943-44 was served on the appellant on  March	 27,
1952,  for  the year 1944-45 on February 16, 1953,  for	 the
year  1946-47 on April 4, 1951 and for the year	 1947-48  on
April  2,  1952.   The	Income	Tax  Officer  completed	 the
assessments  in	 respect of the years 1943-44, 1944  45	 and
1947-48 on May 6, 1953 and for the year 1946-47 on March 19,
1952.	The  orders  of assessment  were  confirmed  by	 the
Appellate  Assistant  Commissioner  and by  the	 Income	 Tax
Appellate Tribunal.  At the instance of37the  appellant, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal drew up  a
statement  of the case unders. 66(1)of the Income Tax	 Act
and submitted to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay	 the
following two questions:(I).	  Whether  the notices issued unders. 22(2)of	 the
Act  read  withs. 34of the Act for  the  assessment  years
1943-44, 1944-45, 1946-47 and 1947-48 were served after	 the
period of limitation prescribed bys.	34of the Act?
(2)  If the answer to Question No. 1 is in the	affirmative,
whether	 the  assessments  for the years  in  question	were
invalid in law?The  High Court answered the first question in the  negative
and observed that on that answer, the second question "	 did
not  arise  ".	With special leave underArt.	136of	 the
Constitution,  this  appeal is preferred  by  the  appellant
against the order of the High Court.The  only  question  which falls to be	determined  in	this
appeal	is  whether  the  proceedings  for  assessment	were
commenced  within  the period of limitation  prescribed	 for
serving	 notice of assessment unders. 34(1)(a)of the	Act.
At  the	 material  time, bys. 34(1)(a),  the	 Income	 Tax
Officer	 was invested with power amongst others to serve  at
any  time  within eight years from the end of  any  year  of
assessment notice of assessment if he had reason to  believe
that  income,  profits or gains had  escaped  assessment  by
reason of omission or failure on the part of the assessee to
make a return of his income unders. 22for that year, or to
disclose  fully and truly all material facts  necessary	 for
his  assessment	 of  that year.	 In those  cases  where	 the
Income Tax Officer had in consequence of information in	 his
possession  reason to believe that income, profits or  gains
had escaped assessment even though there was no omission  or
failure	 as  mentioned in el. (a), he could  under  cl.	 (b)
within	four  years from the end of the year  of  assessment
serve  a  notice  of assessment.   Admittedly,	the  notices
issued	by the Income Tax Officer for the years in  question
were issued within eight years from the end of the years  of
assessment  and	 if  el.  (1)(a)  ofs.  34applied,	 the
assessment was not barred by the law of limitation.38But the appellant contended that the notices for  assessment
were, even though he had not made a return of his income for
the years in question, governed not by cl. (1)(a) ofs.	 34,
but  by	 cl.  (1)(b) ofs. 34.	He contended  that  being  a
resident  outside  the taxable territory in the years  of  ,
assessment,  a	general notice unders. 22(1)did  not	give
rise to a liability to submit a return, and his inaction did
not  amount  to	 omission or failure  to  submit  a  return,
inviting  the  applicability ofs. 34(1)(a).   He  submitted
that omission or failure to make a return can only arise qua
a  non-resident, if no return is filed after service  of  an
individual notice unders. 22(2).  In other words, the	plea
is  that a notice unders. 22(1)imposes an obligation	upon
persons	 resident within the taxable territory and not	upon
non-residents, and support for this argument is sought to be
obtained froms. 1sub-s. (2) which extended theIncome	 Tax
Actat the material time to British India.The expression " every person whose total income during	 the
previous  year	exceeded  the maximum amount  which  is	 not
chargeable to income-tax " ins. 22(1)includes all  persons
who  are  liable  to pay tax and there	is  nothing  in	 the
section	 or in its context which exempts non-residents	from
liability   to	submit	a  return  pursuant  to	  a   notice
thereunder.   The fact that a non-resident assessee may	 not
come to know of the general notice issued unders. 22(1)is
not  a ground for not giving effect to the plain words	used
in  the	 section.   In terms, the clause  read	with  r.  18
requires  every person who has taxable income to submit	 his
return, and if he fails to do so, unders. 34of the Act the
Income	Tax Officer may commence proceedings for  assessment
within	the  period  prescribed	 by  cl.  (1)(a).Section
34(1)(b)applies  only	 to those cases where  there  is  no
omission  or  failure to make a return of the income  or  to
make  a	 full and true disclosure of facts material  to	 the
assessment.  To the appellant though non-resident income bad
admittedly accrued in the taxable territory and that  income
exceeded  the maximum amount not chargeable to	income-tax.,
The appellant not having submitted a return in pursuance  of
the notice issued unders. 221the Income Tax39Officer	 was competent unders. 34(1)(a)to issue notice  at
any  time  within  eight years of the end  of  the  year  of
assessment for assessing him to tax.  Once a notice is given
by  publication	 in the press and in the  prescribed  manner
unders. 22(1), every person whose Th. income	exceeds	 the
maximum amount exempt from tax is obliged to submit a return
and  if he does not do so, it will be deemed that there	 was
omission  on his part to a make a return within the  meaning
ofs. 34(1)(a).	 There is no warrant for the submission that
s. 22(1) applies to residents only and that an obligation to
make a return on the part of a nonresident can only arise if
a notice under sub-s. (2) is served.  Under sub-s. (2) it is
open  to  the Income Tax Officer to serve a  special  notice
upon  any  person requiring him to furnish a return  in	 the
prescribed  form, but that provision does not derogate	from
the liability arising under sub-s. (1) to submit a return.The  Income  Tax  Actextends bys.  1(2)to	the  taxable
territory  and	not beyond; but within that  territory,	 the
Income	Tax Officer has power to tax income  which  accrues,
arises	or  is	received, and that is not  disputed  by	 the
appellant.   If power to tax be granted, it is difficult  to
appreciate  the	 ground on which the plea that	the  general
provision imposing liability upon persons receiving  taxable
income is subject to an unexpressed limitation that it is to
apply  only  to	 residents and not  to	non-residents.	 The
submission  that  a person liable to pay  tax  but  resident
outside the taxable territory must be served with a  special
notice	unders. 22(2)before his inaction in the matter  of
making a return may be deemed omission within the meaning of
s.  34(1)  is  without	force.	There  is  no  such  express
provision  made by the statute and none can be implied	from
the context.The  High  Court  was therefore right in  holding  that	 the
proceedings  for assessment were properly  commenced  within
the period of limitation prescribed bys. 34(1)(a)from	 the
close  of the year of assessment.  The appeal fails  and  is
dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed.40
