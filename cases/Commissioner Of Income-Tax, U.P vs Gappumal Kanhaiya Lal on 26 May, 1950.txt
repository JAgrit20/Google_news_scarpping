Ahmad  C.J.  and Allsop J.) dated 31st August,	1944,  in  a

by
  MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN J.--This appeal from a judgment of	 the
High  Court  of Judicature at Allahabad.dated  31st  August,
1944, raises the same points as have been discussed in Civil
Appeal No. 66 of 1940 (1).  The Income-tax Appellate  Tribu-
nal referred four questions to the High Court of  Judicature
at Allahabad undersection 66( 1 ) of theIndian Income.tax
Act.  These  questions	related to the	year  of  assessment
1930-40.   The High Court answered two of the  questions  in
the affirmative and two in the negative.  The two  questions
relating  to the appeal are those that were answered in	 the
affirmative and are as follows :--"Whether (1) the amount of house-tax and (2) the  amount
of  water-tax, imposed by the Municipal Board  of  Allahabad
undersection	128, sub-section (1) clauses  (i)  and	(x),
respectively  of  the United provincesMunicipalities	Act,
1916, and paid by the owner as a lessor undersection 149of
that  Act should be deducted as an allowance from  the	bona
fide  annual  value of the property  determined	 under	sub-
section	 (1) read with sub-section (2) ofsection 9of	 the
Act,  on  the ground that such amount is an  annual  charge,
which  is  not	a capital charge to which  the	property  is
subject within the meaning of clause (iv) of sub-section (1)
ofsection 9of the Act."(1)  New  piecegoodsBazar  Co.  Ltd.	v.  Commissioner  of
Income-tax, Bombay[1950] S.C.R. 553.565Under section 128 of the United Provinces Municipalities
Act, 1916, the municipality can impose a tax in the whole or
any  part of the municipality on the annual value of  build-
ings or land or of both, and a water-tax on the annual value
of  buildings  or land or of both.  Every such	tax  on	 the
annual value of buildings or land or both is leviable on the
actual	occupier of the property upon which the	 said  taxes
are  assessed, if he is the owner of the buildings or  lands
or holds them on a building or other lease from the Crown or
from the Board, or on a building lease from any person.	  In
any  other case the tax is leviable from the lessor, if	 the
property is let (videsection 149).Section 177enacts that
all sums due on account of a tax imposed on the annual value
of  buildings or lands or both shall, subject to  the  prior
payment	 of  the land revenue, i.f any, due to	His  Majesty
thereupon, be a first charge upon such buildings or lands.
    It	is  apparent therefore that the	 provisions  of	 the
United Provinces Act in respect of the levy of the taxes are
substantially  similar to the provisions of the	 Bombay	 Act
discussed  in Civil Appeal No. 66 of 1949 (1). For the	rea-
sons  given in that appeal and as a result of that  decision
this appeal stands dismissed with costs and we consider that
the High Court of Allahabad has answered the questions above
mentioned correctly.Appeal dismissed.Agent for the appellant:  P.A. Mehta.Agent for the respondent:  S.P. Varma.(1) [1950] S.C.R. 553.566
