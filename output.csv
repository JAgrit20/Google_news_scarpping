The Delhi Police today launched patrolling on bicycle to improve policing in congested localities in trans-Yamuna region of the city. The move is also being billed as a green initiative. The bicycle patrols will complement and supplement the existing motorcycle and PCR patrols which focus mainly on crime prevention along the arterial and main roads of Delhi, police said.

The bicycle patrol was flagged off by Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, the Union minister of state for home affairs, in the presence of Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari and Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik. He flagged off the first batch of 65 bicycles allotted to the Eastern Range of Delhi Police that comprises three districts — east, northeast and Shahdara.

IRCTC Uttarakhand tour package: Tour date, costs, itinerary and more details
IRCTC is offering an eight nights, nine days tour package to Uttarakhand that will cover Mussoorie, Corbett, Nainital and Ranikhet.

IRCTC is offering an eight nights, nine days tour package to Uttarakhand that will cover Mussoorie, Corbett, Nainital and Ranikhet. The state of Uttarakhand is also known as ‘Devbhumi’ (Land of Gods) because of the many pilgrimage sites nesting in its hills. Uttarakhand is known for the natural environment of the Himalayas, the Bhabhar and the Terai. It borders Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north; Nepal to the east; Uttar Pradesh to the south and Himachal Pradesh to the west and north-west.

The IRCTC tour package ‘Hill stations of Uttarakhand’ (package code: SHR064) can be booked any time throughout the year. The tour begins on Tuesdays all around the year. The locations covered in the package include the most picturesque sights in the state. In Mussoorie, tourists can take a nature walk across ‘Camel’s Back Road’. This road takes its name from a rocky outcrop in the shape of a camel’s hump. There is also ‘Gun Hill’ where a cannon was used to sound out midday for many years, and Happy Valley that has a small Tibetan Temple. Jim Corbett National Park is the oldest national park in India, named after the hunter-turned-conservationist Jim Corbett who played a key role in its establishment, which was established in 1936 as Hailey National Park.

Nainital is set in a valley containing a mango-shaped lake, approximately two miles in circumference, and surrounded by mountains, Naina on the north, Deopatha on the west, and Ayarpatha on the south. Ranikhet is a hill station which means Queen’s Meadow (in Hindi), gets its name from a local legend that Raja Sudhardev won the heart of his queen, Rani Padmini, who subsequently chose the area for her residence, giving it the name, Ranikhet, though no palace exists in the area. It was previously under the Nepalese Rule, and the Kumaonese (people of Kumaon Region) won it under the leadership of their able General Kashi Nath Adhikari – after whom the small town of Kashipur was named (which at one point of time was the gateway to the hills and is now an educational/institutional hub) – with the help of Britishers at around 1816 and is a part of India now.
